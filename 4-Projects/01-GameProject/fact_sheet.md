# Conceptual Facts Document — BCI Narrative (v1.3)

## Fact 1

A researcher (me) is running a cutting-edge, secret project in an underground facility.

* *Implication:* Establishes the setting, authority, and control required for everything that follows.

## Fact 2

The secret project focuses on developing and using brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) for various purposes.

* *Implication:* BCI is the project’s core toolset; all later mechanisms must flow through BCI capabilities.

## Fact 3

The player’s character is in a comatose state after a traumatic brain injury.

* *Implication:* Explains why the character is eligible for invasive and experimental BCI procedures.

## Fact 4

A less invasive "Confabulation BCI" has been used on the subject for some time to maintain mental stability. This BCI stimulates the brain to weave a coherent "real life" narrative on its own. The content of this experience cannot be directly controlled, only the intensity of the confabulation.

* *Implication:* This explains the character's continuous, subjective belief that they are living a normal life, which serves as the backdrop to the main events. This is the "dream" the new experiment will intrude upon.

## Fact 5

The project's groundbreaking new phase involves a separate, controllable "Deep BCI" that creates visual images directly in the mind by interfacing with the visual cortex. This is the actual, real input the character is seeing from the researchers.

* *Implication:* This establishes the technology that the *player* interacts with. From the character's perspective, this is a bizarre and inexplicable intrusion into their perceived reality.

## Fact 6

The Deep BCI tech requires extensive, non-reversible surgery to connect at the level of individual neurons.

* *Implication:* Because of the invasiveness, experimentation is limited to patients with no realistic hope of recovery, like the player.

## Fact 7

The primary purpose of proceeding with these dangerous, irreversible Deep BCI connections is to map and understand human brain function at unprecedented levels of detail.

* *Implication:* Justifies why the research continues despite the risks and why deeper connections are pursued.

## Fact 8

The Deep BCI connection process is slow and risky; with few connections, only the simplest experiences are possible (e.g., black screen with text, no inputs). Complexity grows only as more connections are added.

* *Implication:* Naturally supports a stepwise feature progression for the player's interface, beginning extremely basic and expanding over time.

## Fact 9

Although the project takes place in the modern day, the Deep BCI's early presentations are intentionally basic—mirroring old computing—because its capacity is extremely limited at first.

* *Implication:* Validates the retro, historically styled upgrades that align with staged connection growth.
