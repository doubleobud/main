# Simulation Universe Vision Statement

## Overview
I am commencing a fifty-year, solo hobby endeavor, supported by ample time and a reasonable budget. The goal is to build a computer simulation of an Earth-like world, which will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive fictional universe.

## Unified Experience
This universe will be accessible to consumers through a unified interface, offering interaction via extensive video game elements, written works, and digital cinematic sequences.

## Development Philosophy
The entire project, both the simulation and its surrounding universe, is being developed as an evolving, modular framework. This architecture is designed to be data-driven and plug-in friendly, allowing the project to grow iteratively through the release of small, playable increments.

## Creative Intent
For me, this project also serves as a form of entertainment. I intend to use procedural systems to generate emergent experiences, while continually layering in curated content as a personal creative outlet.

## Design Approach
I want to be methodical and intentional throughout the process while taking my time at each step especially with design aspects where I want to research extensively what has been done before, select the best parts, and attempt to create a new synthesis. This design cycle will be one of the most enjoyable parts of the entire experience for me and I hope to incorporate much of the educational material and entertainment I consume into useful elements I can add to my universe.

## Long-Term Gameplay Scope
The video game elements will eventually include a vast array of experiences including roleplaying, strategy, sandbox, simulation, and management. Many of these elements are required for the simulation aspect of the project anyway.

## Key Influences
Dwarf Fortress, The Sims, Tropico 4, Minecraft, Crusader Kings, Civilization, SimCity, X-Com, Final Fantasy VI, Elder Scrolls, Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII.
