Now you said ideas could be agents. I have wanted to build a simulation of gaining knowledge by having keywords assemble into more broad or specific ideas in a hierarchy etc. As you acquire nodes in the hierarchy, you can different types of knowledge and information to the digital person's virtual "brain" etc. Work that out as a full proposal based on best practices as much as possible.

Awesome brief. Here’s a **clean, best-practices proposal** for an agent-based simulation in which **ideas/keywords** form and evolve into **hierarchies**, and a **digital person** acquires and uses those knowledge nodes over time.

---

# 1) Objective (what this sim is for)

* **Model knowledge formation** as interactions among *idea agents* (concepts/keywords) and a *learner agent* (the digital person).
* Show how **exposure → recognition → understanding → mastery → use/transfer** emerges from simple rules.
* Produce **explainable outputs**: “why” a concept was formed, merged, forgotten, or applied.

---

# 2) Core representations (the data you’ll track)

## 2.1 Concept graph (knowledge structure)

* **Nodes** = concepts/ideas (some atomic, some composite).
* **Edges (typed):**

  * `isA` (taxonomy/hierarchy), `partOf` (compositional), `prerequisiteOf` (learning order),
  * `relatedTo` (associative), `contradicts` (incompatibility), `implies` (inference).
* **Attributes:** label(s), short definition, example set, **embedding** (vector), difficulty, abstraction level, stability.
* **Edge weights:** confidence, provenance (which sources/experiences support it), timestamps.

## 2.2 Keyword layer (evidence surface)

* Keywords/phrases map to concept nodes via **similarity** (cosine of embeddings) and curated aliases.
* New keywords can **propose** new concept nodes or **attach** to existing ones with confidence.

## 2.3 Learner model (the digital person)

* **Working memory** (small, fast, distractible).
* **Long-term memory** with **mastery per node** (0–1), uncertainty, and **retention curve parameters**.
* **Activation** (spreading activation from current focus).
* **Metacognitive state:** curiosity, fatigue, confidence; a simple scalar first, richer later.
* **Skill schemas** (optional): procedures linked to prerequisite concepts.

## 2.4 Information sources (the environment)

* Streams of items (notes, articles, flashcards, conversations), each with:

  * Keyword distribution, difficulty, noise level, **source reliability**, modality (text/diagram), time cost.

---

# 3) Simulation mechanics (how it evolves)

## 3.1 Initialization

* Seed the concept graph with a *minimal taxonomy* in the target domain.
* Initialize learner mastery (mostly low), retention parameters (e.g., Ebbinghaus-style forgetting), and attention policy (random or simple heuristics).

## 3.2 Tick loop (one step = one study/experience unit)

1. **Expose** an item from a source (selected by a policy).
2. **Perceptual parsing → keyword detection → concept candidates** via similarity + aliases.
3. **Comprehension check**: for each candidate concept `c`, update a *likelihood of understanding* given its prerequisites and current mastery.
4. **Mastery update** for `c`: Bayesian or logistic increase with diminishing returns; update uncertainty.
5. **Graph maintenance** (idea agents at work):

   * **Propose new concept** (cluster of keywords lacks a good parent).
   * **Merge** (two nodes are near-identical) or **split** (node shows bimodal evidence).
   * **Relink** (promote/demote in hierarchy; adjust `prerequisiteOf` if learning order contradicts current structure).
   * **Conflict handling**: if `contradicts` edges activate, open a “disambiguation” subtask rather than averaging.
6. **Forgetting & consolidation**: decay mastery per node; spaced repetition queues items whose predicted recall drops.
7. **Application opportunities**: if a task requires concepts `{c1..ck}`, simulate **transfer** success using mastery + coherence of their subgraph; success adds high-value evidence.

## 3.3 Attention / curriculum policy (how sources are chosen)

* Start simple (pick next item randomly or by **highest expected learning gain** = “knowledge gradient”).
* Upgrade to **multi-armed bandits** (balance exploration vs. exploitation across sources).
* Optionally, add **goal-directed** focus: prioritize nodes on a desired competency path.

---

# 4) Algorithms & best-practice choices

* **Semantic similarity:** sentence/keyword **embeddings** (any off-the-shelf model) to map evidence → concepts.
* **Concept creation:** density-based clustering (DBSCAN/HDBSCAN) over keyword vectors to propose new nodes; human-review flag optional.
* **Prerequisite inference:** look at temporal orderings (which nodes must be known before others were mastered); infer edges with statistical tests; keep confidence scores.
* **Mastery updates:**

  * **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing** (BKT) or **logistic knowledge tracing** (LKT) per node.
  * Parameters: learn rate, slip/guess, forgetting rate; calibrate on simulated quizzes.
* **Retention & scheduling:** exponential or power-law forgetting; **spaced repetition** (e.g., SM-like heuristics) driven by predicted recall probability.
* **Spreading activation:** limited-depth activation (e.g., up to 2 hops) to surface related nodes for review.
* **Truth maintenance:** a simple **Assumption-Based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS)**: store justifications; when contradictions appear, mark nodes/edges as *defeasible* and schedule clarification tasks.
* **Explainability:** keep an *evidence log* per node (source, date, confidence change) and a *why-graph* for each decision (merge/split/relink).

---

# 5) Metrics (how you’ll know it works)

**At the node level**

* Mastery, uncertainty, predicted recall, **time-to-mastery**, revisit count.

**At the graph level**

* **Coverage** (fraction of target syllabus mastered), **depth** (max prerequisite chain mastered), **coherence** (acyclicity, low contradiction density), **compression** (fewer, well-defined nodes vs. sprawl).

**At the task level**

* **Transfer** success on composite tasks, **time-to-solve**, **error types** (confusion between siblings, missing prerequisite).

**Robustness**

* Degradation under noise, mislabelled sources, contradictory items.

**Human-legible**

* “Because” reports: the top 3 justifications for each new edge or node change.

# 6) Minimal viable prototype (MVP)

**Goal:** demonstrate end-to-end learning with visible concept growth and mastery.

1. **Seed taxonomy:** \~150 concepts in one domain (e.g., intro statistics).
2. **Sources:** 3–5 synthetic streams (short notes) with keyword tags and controlled noise.
3. **Embedding layer:** simple, fixed text embeddings to map keywords → nodes.
4. **Learner:** BKT per node + exponential forgetting; working memory of 5 items; spreading activation depth 1.
5. **Policies:**

   * Item selection = highest expected mastery gain.
   * Review selection = lowest predicted recall above a minimum utility threshold.
6. **Graph maintenance (v1):** only **merge** (cosine > 0.9, same parents) and **new node proposals** (dense clusters without a match).
7. **Visualization:**

   * **Concept map** (DAG) with node color = mastery, rim = uncertainty.
   * **Timeline** of exposures and mastery gains.
   * **Queue** for next-best items (why each is chosen).

**Success criteria for MVP:**

* Mastery curves behave sensibly (fast rise, plateau, decay without review).
* Merges reduce duplicates; proposed nodes are meaningfully novel.
* Transfer tasks that require multiple prerequisites improve as those nodes mature.

---

# 7) Iteration path (adding realism gradually)

* **Prerequisite discovery** from order-of-learning and common co-activation patterns.
* **Split operations** (detect mixed clusters; create child nodes and reassign evidence).
* **Contradiction handling** (ATMS + “decide between competing definitions”).
* **Bandit policy** for source choice with **context** (fatigue, difficulty).
* **Metacognition** (confidence calibration; choose to test vs. study).
* **Multiple learners** (social signal diffusion, peer influence, teaching effects).
* **Task feedback loop** (errors spawn remedial subgoals; success increases retention).

---

# 8) Data schemas (concrete but lightweight)

**Concept node**

```
id, labels[], definition, embedding_vec, difficulty∈[0,1], abstraction_level,
created_at, updated_at, provenance[], stability_score
```

**Edge**

```
source_id, target_id, type∈{isA, partOf, prerequisiteOf, relatedTo, contradicts, implies},
weight∈[0,1], confidence∈[0,1], provenance[], timestamps[]
```

**Learner state (per concept)**

```
mastery∈[0,1], predicted_recall∈[0,1], uncertainty∈[0,1],
last_seen_at, repetition_count, forgetting_params
```

**Evidence item**

```
source_id, text, keywords[], difficulty, reliability, time_cost, timestamp
```

---

# 9) Simulation loop (pseudocode)

```
while t < T:
  item = select_item(policy, learner_state, concept_graph)
  concepts = detect_concepts(item.keywords, concept_graph, embeddings)
  for c in concepts:
      if prerequisites_satisfied(c, learner_state, concept_graph):
          learner_state[c].mastery = update_mastery(learner_state[c], item.difficulty)
      else:
          schedule_prereqs(c)

  concept_graph = maintain_graph(concept_graph, concepts, evidence=item)

  update_forgetting(learner_state, dt)
  schedule_reviews(learner_state)

  if task_due(t):
      result = attempt_task(learner_state, task_requirements, concept_graph)
      incorporate_task_feedback(learner_state, result)
```

# 10) Interfaces & visualizations (make it legible)

* **Map view:** DAG/“skill tree” with mastery heatmap and edge confidences.
* **Learning ledger:** row-by-row evidence log per node with deltas.
* **Planner pane:** “why this next” with expected gain.
* **Conflicts panel:** unresolved contradictions and proposed clarifications.
* **Task dashboard:** transfer tasks, success rates, bottleneck nodes.

---

# 11) Validation plan

* **Face validity:** domain experts quickly recognize sensible hierarchies.
* **Construct validity:** simulated forgetting matches known curves; spacing improves recall.
* **Criterion validity:** performance on held-out tasks tracks predicted mastery.
* **Ablations:** remove each mechanism (spacing, prerequisites, merges) to verify it mattered.

---

# 12) Risks & mitigations

* **Ontology creep** (too many near-duplicates) → strict merge rules + manual review queue.
* **Spurious edges** from noisy text → require multi-source corroboration before promoting edges.
* **Confirmation bias** (only easy items) → exploration term in policy; diversity constraints.
* **Opaque behavior** → mandatory evidence logs and “because” tooltips on all changes.

---

# 13) Tech notes (implementation-agnostic but practical)

* Works well in a scripting environment (e.g., Python) with:

  * Graph ops (e.g., NetworkX),
  * Vector math (NumPy),
  * Optional ML (any embedding model),
  * Simple web UI for the dashboards.
* Keep randomness **seeded** for reproducibility; log every decision with timestamps.
* Store graph + learner state as versioned snapshots to enable time travel/comparisons.

---

## Deliverables you can aim for

1. **MVP sim** + reproducible runs (config files).
2. **Dashboard** showing the concept map and learning timeline.
3. **Report** with metrics (coverage, coherence, transfer) across a few scenarios.
4. **Scenario pack**: clean curriculum vs. noisy feeds vs. contradictory sources.

If you want, I can turn this into a **concrete MVP backlog** (user stories + acceptance tests) or a **seed taxonomy** for a specific subject so you can run the first experiment quickly.
