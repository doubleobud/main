# Master Concept Document Overview

This document will begin with a vision statement framing the overall project. We will better define the project through a long series of "pillars" that will represent a fundamental unit of the project. Each pillar will then receive it's own design treatment leading to a series of "systems" from which the process will continue to break the elements into smaller sections until we reach a small section that is implementable. 

# Vision Statement

Commence a fifty-year, solo hobby endeavor, supported by ample time and a reasonable budget. The goal is to build a computer simulation of an Earth-like world, which will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive fictional universe which will be accessible to consumers through a unified interface, offering interaction via extensive video game elements, written works, and digital cinematic sequences.

# Pillar 1: Role-Playing (RPG)
1.1 **Computer/Western RPG (CRPG / WRPG)**  
1.2 **Japanese RPG (JRPG)**  
1.3 **Open-World RPG**  
1.4 **Idle RPG**  
1.5 **Tabletop RPG (Digital Adaptation)**  

# Pillar 2: Strategy
2.1 **Turn-Based Strategy (TBS)**  
2.2 **Turn-Based Tactics (TBT)**  
2.3 **4X (Explore / Expand / Exploit / Exterminate)**  
2.4 **Grand Strategy**  
2.5 **Tower Defense**  
2.6 **Auto-Battler**

# Pillar 3: Simulation
3.1 **Construction & Management Simulation (CMS)**  
 3.1.1 **City Builder**  
 3.1.2 **Colony Simulation**  
 3.1.3 **Tycoon / Business Simulation**  
3.2 **Life Simulation**  
3.3 **God Simulation (God Game)**  

# Pillar 4: Action
4.1 **Immersive Simulation (Action–Simulation Hybrid)**  
4.2 **Survival-Craft (Action–Simulation Hybrid)**  

# Pillar 5: Narrative / Adventure
5.1 **Interactive Fiction (Text Adventure)**  

# Cross-Cutting Modifiers
- **Roguelike / Roguelite** *(structural style: permadeath, procedural generation, meta-progression)*  
- **Sandbox** *(play style: player freedom, open systems, emergent goals)*
