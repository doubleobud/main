## 3) Architecture Strategy

**3.1 Target Architecture (narrative + diagram):** cloud(s), regions, multi‑tenant vs. single‑tenant, data isolation, edge strategy.
**3.2 Architectural Principles:**

* Keep boundaries crisp (DDD bounded contexts).
* Public contracts stable; internals evolvable.
* Prefer asynchronous, idempotent flows; at‑least‑once semantics with dedupe keys.
* Compute near data; cache near users.
* Everything behind an SLO; error budgets govern change.

**3.3 Domain Decomposition (DDD)**

* Contexts: Identity, Accounts, Billing, Catalog, Workflow, Analytics, Admin, Support.
* Anti‑corruption layers between legacy and new.

**3.4 Data Strategy**

* Master/Reference data, golden records, data contracts, schema registry.
* Event backbone (e.g., Kafka) with event versioning & immutability.
* Data classification, retention, regional residency, encryption in transit/at rest.

**3.5 API Strategy**

* Style: REST/JSON + Async events; GraphQL if justified; gRPC for internal.
* Versioning: URI or header; **no breaking changes** without deprecation window and dual‑write/dual‑read.
* Contract tests, schema diff gates in CI.

**3.6 Performance & Scale**

* Target latencies (P50/P95/P99), throughput ceilings, autoscaling rules.
* Capacity model with growth factors; annual load test plan.

**3.7 Interop & Standards**

* Open standards for identity, audit, logging; import/export formats; customer data portability.

---

## 4) Security & Trust

**4.1 Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):** threat modeling, secure code reviews, SAST/DAST, dependency scanning, SBOM, code signing.
**4.2 Access Controls:** least privilege, JIT access, strong MFA, break‑glass, approval workflows.
**4.3 Data Protection:** KMS strategy, key rotation, FIPS/FedRAMP requirements (if applicable), tokenization, secrets mgmt.
**4.4 Privacy:** data mapping, DPIAs, consent, subject rights, regional handling (GDPR/CCPA).
**4.5 Vulnerability Mgmt:** SLAs by severity; patch windows; customer advisories; CVE watch.
**4.6 Third‑Party Risk:** vendor due diligence, penetration testing cadence, bug bounty.
**4.7 Audit Readiness:** evidence automation (logs, configs, change mgmt) mapped to controls.

---

## 5) Reliability, SRE & Operations

**5.1 SLOs & Error Budgets**

* Define user‑visible SLOs per critical user journey (availability, latency, freshness).
* Error budgets fund stability; freeze changes when budgets are exhausted.

**5.2 Incident Mgmt**

* Severity matrix, on‑call rotations, runbooks, paging policy, incident comms templates.
* Post‑incident reviews (blameless), actions tracked with owners/SLAs.

**5.3 DR & Continuity**

* RTO/RPO targets per service; multi‑AZ + multi‑region strategy; quarterly failover drills; backups with regular restores tested.

**5.4 Observability**

* Three pillars: logs, metrics, traces; RED/USE dashboards; adaptive alerts.
* Golden signals for each service; sampling strategy for traces; profiling for hot paths.

**5.5 Capacity & Cost**

* FinOps: budgets, unit cost KPIs, auto‑rightsizing; forecast vs. actual monthly.

---

## 6) Delivery Model & Governance

**6.1 Operating Model**

* Two‑tier planning: **Quarterly bets** (themes/outcomes) + **bi‑weekly execution**.
* Trunk‑based or short‑lived branches; CI required; feature flags; progressive delivery (canary, blue‑green).

**6.2 Release Strategy**

* Release trains for customer‑facing artifacts; hotfix lane; change approval by risk tier and blast radius.
* Public changelog; compatibility matrix; support policy (N‑2).

**6.3 Quality Gates**

* Definition of Ready/Done; test pyramid (unit, contract, integration, e2e), non‑functional tests (perf/security/chaos).

**6.4 Governance & Councils**

* **Architecture Review Board (ARB):** approves cross‑cutting decisions.
* **Change Advisory Board (CAB):** risk‑based, lightweight for low risk.
* **Data Governance Council:** stewardship, retention, access.

**6.5 Metrics & Reviews**

* Engineering: DORA, lead time, change fail %, CFR, MTTR.
* Product: adoption, retention, NPS, expansion, utilization.
* Reliability: SLO attainment, incident rate, toil %.

---

## 7) Compliance & Regulatory (choose what applies)

* SOC 2 / ISO 27001 ISMS scope; policies (access, change, incident, vendor, DR, secure dev).
* HIPAA/PCI‑DSS data handling if in scope; attestations; segmentation.
* Government (e.g., FedRAMP/StateRAMP): SSP, boundary diagram, controls, POA\&M.

# Lifelong Game — Kickoff (Overview)

> A master kickoff to build and steward a **single video game as a multi‑decade product** with frequent, incremental releases. Designed to stay genre‑agnostic and pivot‑ready while protecting a few core invariants. Treat this as your **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** and update quarterly.

---

## Front Matter

* **Game/Universe Title:**
* **Studio/Owner:**
* **Executive Steward(s):** Creative Director / Technical Director / Live Ops Lead
* **Core Promise (1–2 sentences):** What this game always delivers, even if genre shifts.
* **Canon/Setting:** (if any) and how mutable it is
* **Business Model:** Premium / DLC / F2P / Hybrid / Subscription
* **Target Platforms:** PC / Console / Mobile / Cloud
* **SSOT Location:**
* **Version:** 0.1 (Draft / In Review / Approved)
* **Lifecycle Stage:** Incubation / Foundational Release / Seasonal Cadence / Mature Ecosystem / Legacy & Archive
* **Last Updated:**

### TL;DR

* What are the **invariants** that will not change over 20+ years?
* What is the **Minimum Lovable Game** (MLG) you can ship in ≤ 24 months?
* How will you **ship small, often**, without breaking the world or players’ trust?

---

## 1) North Star & Invariants

**1.1 Future Postcard (10 years):** write one paragraph from the future—what the game means to players, the culture/community around it, and the ecosystem of creators.
**1.2 Immutable Tenets (5–7):** examples: *Fairness over monetization*, *Player agency first*, *Readable not realistic*, *Mod‑friendliness*, *Backwards compatibility by default*, *No pay‑to‑win*.
**1.3 Flexible Constraints:** what can change (genre, perspective, combat model, camera, narrative style).
**1.4 Canon Policy:** what is canon, how retcons work, and rules for parallel timelines/alternate modes.

---

## 2) Multi‑Horizon Strategy

**H1 — Foundation (0–24 months):** ship the MLG: a stable core loop, creator pipeline, and live service basics.
**H2 — Growth (2–5 years):** add adjacent modes/genres (e.g., builder → tactics → action), grow UGC ecosystem, expand platforms.

## 3) Genre‑Agnostic Game Architecture

**3.1 Systems as Lego**

* **Entity‑Component‑System (ECS):** components for movement, inventory, ability, AI, UI, net sync.
* **Verbs System:** atomic actions (move, aim, build, trade, converse, craft, solve) declared as data; genres compose verbs.
* **Interaction Graph:** object × verb × rule matrix; designers extend via data, not code changes.
* **Mode Framework:** `Mode` interfaces (Action, Strategy, Builder, Narrative, Racing, Social, Sandbox) as plugins sharing the same world state.

**3.2 Physics & Math Packs**

* Pluggable backends: character controller, rigid/soft bodies, vehicle dynamics, ballistics, navmesh/flowfields; fixed‑/float‑point swap if needed.

**3.3 Persistence & Migration**

* Save format: schema‑versioned, append‑only event log + state snapshots; deterministic migrations; forward‑compatible readers.
* Content addressing (GUIDs) for assets and rules; provenance tracked for audits/rollbacks.

**3.4 API & Extensibility**

* Public scripting (Lua/C#/Blueprints) with sandboxed capabilities.
* Plugin API for modes, UI widgets, AI behaviors, economy rules, net transport.
* Stable **data contracts**; semantic versioning; deprecation windows ≥ 12 months.

**3.5 Rendering & UI**

* Style‑agnostic pipeline: toon ↔ PBR toggles, camera layers (isometric/FPS/side‑scroll), theming tokens; accessibility baked in.

**3.6 Input & Accessibility**

* Abstraction for keyboard/mouse, controller, touch, assistive devices; full remap; latency budgets per platform.

---

## 4) Networking, Scale & Ops

**4.1 Net Models:** offline, async, deterministic lockstep (small sessions), server‑authoritative (competitive/co‑op), social hubs.
**4.2 Regions & Matchmaking:** skill‑ & latency‑aware; cross‑play gates; cloud saves & cross‑progression.
**4.3 Observability:** client & server metrics (latency P50/95/99, tick drift), crash capture, replays/ghosts.
**4.4 Anti‑Cheat & Integrity:** behavioral + client integrity + server validation; reporting flows; ban ladder with appeals.
**4.5 DR & Continuity:** multi‑region failover, player session recovery, rollback netcode where useful.

---

## 5) Content Platform & Tools

* **Editor/Toolchain:** one content pipeline for all modes; batch importers; procedural generation hooks; kitbashing libraries.
* **Style Bible:** shapes, palette, readability rules scalable from low‑fi to high‑fi.
* **Budget Tokens:** perf budgets per platform (CPU/GPU/mem/draw calls); asset import presets; validation gates in CI.
* **Creator SDK:** docs, sample mods, safety review pipeline, revenue share knobs (if marketplace).

---

## 6) Live Ops & Release Management

**6.1 Release Trains:** weekly patches → monthly content drops → quarterly expansions → annual LTS branch.
**6.2 Feature Flags & Experiments:** server‑driven toggles, A/B tests, canary rings, kill‑switches.
**6.3 Events Calendar:** seasonal themes, rotating rule‑sets/modes, limited‑time challenges; anniversary beats.
**6.4 Compatibility & Deprecation:** N‑2 support, migration aides, sunset playbooks; public EOL calendar.
**6.5 Runbooks:** patch/hotfix/rollback, incident comms, store update checklist.

---

## 7) Economy, Progression & Balance

* **Economy Model:** soft currency, hard currency (optional), sinks vs. sources, inflation controls, pity timers, crafting/loot tables.
* **Progression Scaffolding:** account level, mastery trees, collections, seasons/battle pass (cosmetic‑forward), evergreen goals.
* **Fairness Charter:** cosmetics only for paid advantages (if F2P), accessibility safeguards, no predatory loops.
* **Balance Council:** telemetry‑informed patching; sandbox servers for testing; notes & timelines for nerfs/buffs.

---

## 8) Community, UGC & Governance

* **Channels:** Discord/forums, in‑game news, creator program, PTR/test realm.
* **Moderation:** clear code of conduct, reporting, transparency reports, player councils.
* **UGC Policies:** content guidelines, IP considerations, revenue share (if marketplace), takedown process, rating/curation.
* **Accessibility & Inclusion:** design standards, localization roadmap, community safety features.

---

## 9) Narrative & Canon Stewardship (optional)

* **Universe Bible:** factions, eras, motifs; rules for contradictions.
* **Story Arcs:** seasonal structure; opt‑in lore vs. gameplay necessities.
* **Parallel Timelines:** how alternate rulesets/modes coexist without breaking canon.

---

## 10) Data, Telemetry & Experimentation

* **Data Model:** events for session start/stop, economy flows, cohort tags, difficulty curves, churn signals.
* **KPIs:** D1/D7/D30 retention, MAU/DAU, ARPDAU/ARPPU, conversion, match completion %, crash‑free %, report rate, wishlist rate (if applicable).
* **Experimentation:** hypothesis → metric move → guardrails; ethics guidelines; publish patch notes with outcomes.
* **Privacy & Compliance:** GDPR/CCPA minors handling, consent, deletion/portability, regional storage.

---

## 11) Security & Compliance

* **Security Baseline:** code signing, SBOM, dependency scanning, secret management, secure transport.
* **Cheat/Exploit Response:** responsible disclosure, bounty (optional), hotfix SLA.
* **Ratings & Platform Policies:** ESRB/PEGI; console cert checklists; parental controls.
