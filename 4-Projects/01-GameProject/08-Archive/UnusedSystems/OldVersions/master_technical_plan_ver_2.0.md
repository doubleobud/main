### **Project Constellation: Technical Architecture Overview**

#### **1. Vision & Guiding Philosophy**

Project Constellation is a decades-scale, solo-developed game that ascends a "genre ladder," allowing a player to create a world and then inhabit it across vastly different scales of play. The technical architecture must therefore prioritize extreme modularity, long-term maintainability, and the ability to evolve without invalidating prior work. The guiding philosophy is to employ proven, high-level software engineering principles to build a system that is not just a game, but a stable and extensible platform for emergent storytelling.

#### **2. The Core Architectural Pillars**

The entire project is built upon six foundational pillars that work in concert:

1.  **Entity Component System (ECS):** The core data structure. Defines *what things are*.
2.  **Event Bus Architecture:** The central nervous system. Manages *how things communicate*.
3.  **Dependency Injection (IoC):** The master assembly line. Manages *how systems are built and connected*.
4.  **Plugin/Module Architecture:** The physical blueprint. Enforces *true separation between game layers*.
5.  **Formal Persistence Strategy:** The time capsule. Ensures *data survives forever*.
6.  **Automated Testing Framework:** The quality control system. Guarantees *stability and confidence*.

#### **3. Detailed Architectural Layers**

##### **Layer 1: The Foundation - Entity Component System (ECS)**

At the lowest level, the entire state of the simulation is represented by ECS.

  * **Entities:** Simple identifiers (IDs). They are empty containers.
  * **Components:** Pure, raw data structs (e.g., `Position`, `Health`, `Inventory`). They contain no logic. They are the LEGO bricks of the universe.
  * **Systems:** Pure logic. These are the workers that operate on entities possessing specific combinations of components (e.g., a `MovementSystem` acts on entities with `Position` and `Velocity`).

**Benefit:** This data-centric approach provides immense flexibility, allowing for the emergent behaviors required by a deep sandbox. New entity types can be created by simply combining components in new ways, often driven entirely by data files rather than new code.

##### **Layer 2: The Nervous System - Event Bus & Command Bus**

Systems are completely decoupled and communicate indirectly through a central bus.

  * **Event Bus (Pub/Sub):** When a system's action has consequences, it publishes an **Event** (a data object describing what *happened*). Other systems can subscribe to these events and react independently. For example, the `CombatSystem` publishes a `CharacterDiedEvent`, which is then heard by the `AudioSystem` (to play a sound), the `LineageSystem` (to handle succession), and the `UISystem` (to show an obituary).
  * **Command Bus:** To maintain a clear separation of concerns, systems issue **Commands** (requests for an action to be *performed*). Each command has a single handler. For example, the `InputSystem` issues a `DamageEntityCommand`; the `CombatSystem` is the sole handler that contains the logic for processing that damage.

**Benefit:** This creates a "feedback-first" architecture where modules can be added or removed without breaking existing logic. The `CombatSystem` doesn't need to know that a `LineageSystem` even exists.

##### **Layer 3: The Assembly Line - Dependency Injection (IoC)**

Systems do not create their own dependencies; they are "injected" at startup by an Inversion of Control (IoC) container.

  * **Process:** At game launch, a central IoC container constructs all necessary services (like the Event Bus). It then constructs each System, automatically providing them with the dependencies they declare they need (e.g., passing the Event Bus instance into the `CombatSystem`'s constructor).
  * **Benefit:** This makes every system highly testable in isolation and easily configurable. You can swap out a "live" system for a "test" system without changing any game code, which is critical for maintaining quality over a long project lifetime.

##### **Layer 4: The Physical Structure - Plugin/Module Architecture**

The "Genre Ladder" is physically enforced by compiling the code into separate modules (DLLs/Assemblies).

  * **`Core.dll`:** Contains the absolute essentials: the ECS framework, Event Bus interfaces, and universal components. It has no knowledge of any specific game genre.
  * **`Genre.dll` (e.g., `CRPG.dll`, `ColonySim.dll`):** Each major gameplay layer is its own module. It can only reference `Core.dll`.
  * **Communication:** The `CRPG` module and the `ColonySim` module are physically incapable of referencing each other. Their only means of interaction is through the events and commands defined in the `Core` module.

**Benefit:** This is the ultimate enforcement of modularity. It makes the "pluggable Resolution Engines" a physical reality and ensures feature sprawl in one area cannot create code tangles in another.

##### **Layer 5: The Time Capsule - Persistence & Migration Strategy**

To ensure a player's world can last for years, save files are treated as a permanent data archive.

  * **Serialization:** The game does not save raw component data. It serializes the entire ECS world state into a versioned data format (e.g., JSON DTOs).
  * **Migration:** Upon loading a save file, the system checks the data version. If the version is old, a series of pre-written migration scripts are executed to upgrade the old data structure to the current one, filling in any missing fields with safe defaults.
  * **Benefit:** This guarantees that no code refactor or feature addition will ever invalidate a player's save file, a cornerstone requirement for a "decades-scale" game.

##### **Layer 6: The Safety Net - Automated Testing Framework**

Quality is maintained through a rigorous, automated testing process.

  * **Unit Tests:** Each system's logic is tested in isolation (enabled by Dependency Injection).
  * **Integration Tests:** Tests are written to verify that systems interact correctly via the Event/Command Bus (e.g., "issuing a `CraftItemCommand` results in an `ItemAddedToInventoryEvent`").
  * **Benefit:** Provides the confidence to constantly refactor and add features without fear of breaking the complex, emergent simulation. It is the primary mitigation against the risk of unmanageable complexity.

```

This architecture, while a significant upfront investment, is explicitly designed to handle the core challenges of Project Constellation: massive scope, long-term evolution, and the need for deep, systemic emergence. It provides a stable, testable, and profoundly flexible foundation for the next 50 years of development.

* **Additions for the Master Technical Plan**
Here are the key concepts from the text that should be integrated:

Specific High-Level Systems: The text names several excellent examples of the major systems that would be built within our modular architecture. These should be noted as primary development targets. Examples include:

History & Lineage Engine

Planet Streaming & Chunking System (for performance)

"Maker" Systems (like a Blueprint Studio)

Specific renderers like a Top-Down Tile Renderer and Model Impostor Batcher

Diegetic Modding Tools: The idea that "Modding tools and development frameworks...[can be] unlocked as part of the game experience" is a significant conceptual addition. This powerfully connects the project's development reality to its meta-narrative. This should be added as a long-term goal that bridges the technical plan with the game's core premise.

Advanced Testing Strategy: The concept of using "simulation seeds and deterministic replays" is a powerful technique for quality assurance. This is a perfect addition to Layer 6: The Quality Layer, as it specifically targets the challenge of debugging complex, long-term emergent behaviors that are difficult to capture with traditional unit or integration tests.

Data Pipeline Specifics: The text outlines a clear workflow: "data tables (like CSV or JSON) -> importers -> game-ready prefabs". This is a concrete and proven implementation detail for the Configuration as Code principle and should be adopted as the standard content pipeline.

# Project Constellation: Master Technical Plan v2.0

## Part I: Core Philosophy & Guiding Principles 📜

This document outlines the definitive architectural blueprint for Project Constellation. It is founded on a philosophy of **over-engineering for quality**, prioritizing the project's 50-year lifespan over short-term development velocity. The architecture is designed to be a stable, extensible platform for emergent storytelling, capable of evolving in any direction without compromising its core integrity.

* **Longevity over Speed:** All architectural decisions are made in service of scalability, maintainability, and portability for a multi-decade development cycle.
* **Simulation Purity:** The core simulation logic exists as an abstract, engine-agnostic layer. It calculates the "truth" of the universe, completely unaware of how that truth is rendered, heard, or displayed.
* **Decoupling is Paramount:** Systems are fully isolated and communicate indirectly. This prevents a "web" of dependencies, ensuring the project remains manageable as its complexity grows exponentially.
* **Atoms, Not Molds:** The universe is built from **atoms (raw data)**, not from **molds (rigid classes)**. An object's properties and behaviors are defined by the data components attached to it, not by a restrictive inheritance hierarchy.
* **Configuration as Code:** The **canonical source of truth** for all game data, logic, and initial state resides in version-controlled text and data files (e.g., C#, JSON), not in opaque, editor-specific scene files.

---

## Part II: The Architectural Blueprint: The Seven Layers 🏛️

The architecture is a stack of seven distinct, interacting layers, each with a specific responsibility.

### Layer 0: The Data Layer (ECS)
This is the foundational model for the entire simulation state.
* **Entity:** A simple, unique identifier (an ID). It is an empty container representing a "thing" that exists.
* **Component:** **Pure data**. A component is a block of variables describing a single aspect of an entity (e.g., `Position`, `Health`). Components contain **zero logic**.
* **System:** **Pure logic**. A system is a function that operates on all entities possessing a specific set of components.

### Layer 1: The Communication Layer (Event & Command Bus)
This is the central nervous system of the architecture, ensuring systems remain decoupled.
* **Event Bus (Pub/Sub):** When a system's action has consequences, it publishes an **Event** (a data object describing what *has happened*). Other systems can subscribe to these events and react independently, without any knowledge of the publisher.
* **Command Bus:** To separate intent from execution, systems issue **Commands** (requests for an action to be *performed*). Each command has exactly one handler system responsible for its logic.

### Layer 2: The Construction Layer (Dependency Injection & IoC)
This layer manages how systems are built and connected, eliminating hidden dependencies.
* **Inversion of Control (IoC) Container:** At startup, a central IoC container constructs all services (like the Event Bus) and systems. It automatically **injects** required dependencies into each system's constructor.
* **Benefit:** This makes every system highly testable in isolation and easily configurable.

### Layer 3: The Structural Layer (Plugin/Module Architecture)
The "Genre Ladder" is physically enforced by compiling the code into separate, independently compiled modules (DLLs/Assemblies).
* **`Core.dll`:** Contains only the absolute essentials: the ECS framework, bus interfaces, and universal components. It has no knowledge of any specific game genre.
* **`Genre.dll` (e.g., `CRPG.dll`, `ColonySim.dll`):** Each major gameplay layer is its own module. It can only reference `Core.dll`, enforcing perfect decoupling.

### Layer 4: The Persistence Layer (Serialization & Migration)
This is the "time capsule" of the architecture, ensuring data survives forever.
* **Serialization:** The game saves a simplified, versioned data object (Data Transfer Object or DTO) for each component, not the raw component class. This ensures the data is independent of the code.
* **Migration:** Upon loading, the system checks the data version. If it's an old version, a series of pre-written migration scripts are executed to upgrade the data structure to the current one, ensuring no save file is ever invalidated by code changes.

### Layer 5: The Presentation Layer (Engine Abstraction)
This layer defines the strict boundary between the simulation and the game engine (e.g., Unity).
* **Headless Engine Philosophy:** The engine is treated as a framework or headless engine, not a design studio. Its primary roles are rendering, physics, and providing the main update loop.
* **The Border:** A small, isolated layer of code translates the simulation's state into specific engine commands. The `RenderableComponent` is pure data containing instructions (either procedural parameters or a curated asset ID) for a `RenderingSystem` to interpret.

### Layer 6: The Quality Layer (Automated Testing & Concurrency)
This is the non-negotiable safety net that guarantees stability and performance.
* **Automated Testing:** A comprehensive suite of tests is maintained:
    * **Unit Tests:** Test individual systems in isolation (enabled by DI).
    * **Integration Tests:** Verify that systems interact correctly via the Event/Command Bus.
* **Concurrency by Design:** Because systems are inherently decoupled, the architecture is designed for parallel execution from the start to handle future complexity.

---

## Part III: Implementation Strategy & Workflow ⚙️

These are the practical, day-to-day rules for development.

* **The Bootstrap:** A single `SimulationHost.cs` script serves as the game's sole entry point. It programmatically loads all blueprints, has the IoC container build the systems, and starts the main simulation loop.
* **The Role of the Editor:** The engine's Inspector is an indispensable **live diagnostic and debugging tool**. It is a **read-only** window into the running simulation. It will **never** be used as a source for defining canonical game data.
* **Commitment to Custom Tooling:** We will proactively develop custom editor windows. These tools will provide a user-friendly GUI for viewing and editing our code-based blueprints, combining the robustness of a code-first architecture with the efficiency of a visual workflow.

---

## Part IV: The Path Forward: The First Milestone 🏁

The first practical goal is to implement the simplest possible end-to-end slice of the architecture.

1.  **Setup:** Implement the IoC container, Event Bus, and the `Core.dll` project structure.
2.  **Blueprint:** Create a `blueprint.json` file defining a single entity with `Temperature` and `Renderable` components.
3.  **Systems:**
    * Create a `HeatDissipationSystem` (in a `Simulation.dll` module) that reduces the `Temperature` value each tick and publishes a `TemperatureChangedEvent`.
    * Create a `DebugRenderingSystem` (in an `Engine.Unity.dll` module) that subscribes to `TemperatureChangedEvent` and prints the new value to the console.
4.  **Execution:** The `SimulationHost.cs` bootstrap script reads the blueprint, has the IoC container build and inject the systems, and starts the main loop.
5.  **Persistence:** A `PersistenceSystem` saves the entity's final state to a versioned JSON file on application close.

Successfully completing this milestone will validate every core principle of this Master Technical Plan, providing a rock-solid foundation for the next 50 years of development.

Awesome—let’s harden your technical plan to “enterprise-grade” while keeping it solo-dev friendly. Below is a set of concrete upgrades you can drop into your Master Technical Plan v2.0, organized by capability. I’m aligning with your current pillars (ECS, buses, DI, modules, persistence, testing) and the Unity 6 LTS choice, plus the genre-ladder vision from the concept doc. &#x20;

# Enterprise-grade upgrades to your technical plan

## 1) Platform shape & process

* **Two-process architecture (now, optional multiplayer later):** Run **Simulation Core** (headless, deterministic .NET lib) and **Presentation Host** (Unity) as separate processes connected over a local RPC (named pipes/IPC). Dev builds can run them in one process for convenience. This isolation lets you:

  * crash/replace the renderer without killing the sim,
  * run headless replays & batch tests,
  * grow into MP/spectator tools if ever desired.
* **Semantic versioning + compatibility gates:** Version **Core API**, **Save schema**, **Plugin API**, and **Content data** independently; enforce on startup with clear error surfaces and auto-migrations.
* **ADRs + RFCs:** Add lightweight **Architecture Decision Records** and a mini **RFC** process for any change to Core API/Save schema. (Template + “must pass” checklist.)

## 2) ECS & systems engineering (performance + safety)

* **Archetype ECS with job graph:** Keep your custom ECS data-oriented; introduce a **job graph** per tick that the IoC builds from system declared inputs/outputs. The scheduler runs jobs in parallel with conflict detection (R/W sets).
* **Determinism kit:** Centralize RNG via **SeededRandom** service (per-system streams), fixed-point or deterministic float paths for critical logic, and compile-time flags to forbid non-deterministic APIs inside Simulation Core.
* **Data hygiene:** Prefer **struct components** with burst-friendly layouts; pooled allocators for transient buffers; entity GUIDs stable across sessions (128-bit).

## 3) Event/Command bus at scale

* **Typed contracts + schema evolution:** Define Events/Commands as **versioned DTOs** with an internal schema ID. The bus handles up-cast (old→new) via registered translators.
* **Back-pressure & observability:** Queue metrics (length, drop rate), slow-subscriber detection, and per-topic tracing. Add **priority classes** (simulation-critical vs cosmetic).

## 4) Module & plugin architecture

* **Strict module graph:** `Core.dll` (ECS + bus + contracts) → `Simulation.*.dll` (genre systems) → `Engine.Unity.dll` (adapters) with **no back edges**.
* **Stable Plugin SDK:** Public interfaces live in `Constellation.SDK`. Ship a **capability manifest** (what events/commands/components a plugin may touch), and **capability gates** at load time.
* **Sandboxing:** Support two plugin modes:

  * **Trusted C# assemblies** (first-party).
  * **Sandboxed WASM** for community mods (WASI subset): message-passing only, bounded memory/time, no file/network by default.

## 5) Persistence you can bet a decade on

* **Event-sourced saves with snapshots:**

  * Append-only **world journal** (events) segmented by **region/chunk** + periodic **snapshots** (compact state) for fast loads.
  * On load: snapshot → replay tail → done. Rollback & time-travel come for free in tooling/replays.
* **Schema registry & migrations:** Treat component/DTO schemas like DB schemas:

  * Keep a **schema registry** (JSON/Protobuf) with **compat tests** in CI.
  * Migration scripts run per segment; partial failure = quarantine that segment, keep the rest playable.
* **Save durability:** Double-write + checksum; background scrubbing; auto shadow-backup; corruption heuristics + user-facing repair tool.

## 6) Planet scale streaming

* **Region file system:** World split into `(worldId / LOD / regionX / regionY)` directories. Each region stores components in **columnar blobs** (SoA) for fast selective loads.
* **Predictive prefetch:** Use camera + sim clock to prefetch neighbor regions; **eviction policy** based on heat (access) + memory budget.
* **Asynchronous hydration:** Entities spawn hydrated (minimal components) and lazily **materialize** extra components when needed.

## 7) Presentation boundary (Unity 6 LTS)

* **Thin adapters only:** Presentation reads **RenderIntent** components (pure data) and maps to Unity objects (impostors, tiling, VFX). No game rules in Unity land.
* **Cross-thread data view:** Copy-on-write snapshots from Simulation Core to Presentation Host at frame boundaries to avoid locks.
* **Deterministic debug view:** A “truth overlay” that draws from the same snapshot the renderer sees → invaluable for desync hunts.

## 8) Testing & reliability (beyond unit/integration)

* **Deterministic replay harness:** Every play session emits a seed + input stream; CI replays nightly across OS builds to catch drift.
* **Property-based tests & fuzzers:** Auto-generate entity sets and sequences (crafting, combat, lineage) to find invariant breaks.
* **Soak & chaos:** 24-hour soak runs with **fault injection** (I/O stalls, partial writes, bus delays) to validate recovery paths.
* **Golden scenarios suite:** Curate canonical seeds (e.g., “First Winter,” “Bandit Siege,” “Succession Crisis”) and lock their KPI time-series to detect regressions.

## 9) Observability & analytics (privacy-first, offline-friendly)

* **In-sim telemetry:** Counters, timers, histograms (tick time, queue pressure, region churn, allocs). Add a built-in **Perf HUD**.
* **Flight recorder:** Rolling buffer of last N seconds of events/commands for post-mortem on crash.
* **Diagnostics bundles:** One-click export (logs + save snapshot + replay seed) for bug reports; no PII, works offline.

## 10) Content pipeline (configuration-as-code, but fast)

* **Authoring → import → bake:** CSV/JSON → importers → **baked blobs** with code-gen’d C# structs (no reflection in hot paths).
* **Hot-reload safely:** Diff-aware reload of data tables into a staging world, then transactional swap into live sim at a barrier tick.
* **Data QA:** Validate tables with schemas, referential-integrity checks, and property-tests (e.g., no recipe creates negative mass).

## 11) Security & supply chain

* **Signed builds & SBOM:** Sign all shipped binaries; produce a **Software Bill of Materials**; lock package versions; verify plugin signatures at load.
* **Sandbox boundaries:** Mods get no FS/network by default; explicit caps via capability manifest; resource quotas enforced.

## 12) Performance budgets & targets

* **Tick budget:** Define per-layer budgets (e.g., 8 ms sim, 8 ms render on target spec). Every system reports its slice.
* **Memory budget:** Per region/entity class caps; leak detection in CI; snapshot heap diff on PRs.

## 13) Feature flags & experiments

* **Runtime flags:** Gradually roll systems behind flags; let saves record which flags were active (replay fidelity).
* **Experiment harness:** Toggle alternative algorithms per seed to compare KPIs (deterministic A/B for solo QA).

## 14) Tooling that pays rent

* **World Inspector:** Filterable ECS browser, time-scrubber (replay), event waterfall view, and “what changed this tick?” diffs.
* **Plan Maker (diegetic mod tools):** Route late-game “Maker” UIs to the same import/bake path you use internally so they’re truly first-class. (Matches your concept’s diegetic modding beat.)&#x20;
* **Crash-to-replay:** On exception, auto write a minimal replay + diagnostics bundle.

If you want, I can turn this into a tracked **appendix** for your Master Technical Plan and drop in the milestone tables, checklists, and ADR template so it’s ready to paste. The above slots cleanly into your existing seven-layer blueprint and supports the diegetic modding and genre-ladder goals you’ve laid out. &#x20;
