### **Part I: Foundational Concepts & Vision**

#### **1\. Project Vision & Core Pillars**

Project Constellation is a solo-built, decades-scale game designed to ascend across genres, allowing players to create a world and then step into it to experience its history. The core vision is to provide a single, coherent experience that mirrors the evolution of both civilizations and video games, progressing from **words → life → creation → embodiment → settlement → city → region → globe**. It is a systemic sandbox for players who love builder/strategy layers, deep role-playing, and emergent stories. The project is guided by six key design principles: **clarity over clutter**, **elegant depth**, a **unified grammar** across all systems, **diegetic continuity**, **solo-dev feasibility**, and maximizing **player agency**.

#### **2\. Game Premise & Narrative Framework**

Project Constellation is presented to the player not as a finished game, but as a collaborative project between them and the developer. The experience begins within a meta-narrative framework: the player awakens in a virtual "bunker," conversing with a character who presents himself as the game's novice developer. This developer explains that due to his inexperience and the limitations of their shared technology, they must start with the simplest possible foundation: a story.

The initial gameplay is a digital novel, presented with primitive computer aesthetics. These stories, which the player reads in their virtual room, initially seem to be disconnected fiction. However, they are gradually revealed to be a non-fictional, interconnected history of the post-apocalyptic world outside the bunker—a world where society has collapsed on an Earth-like planet.

This leads to a series of reality-shattering reveals. The player discovers that the "developer" is a character living within this post-apocalyptic world, and the stories describe the invention of a primitive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) used to stimulate and preserve the minds of coma patients. The ultimate reveal is that the player *is* one of these patients. Their perceived "real life" is an illusion generated by the BCI, and their actual body is stored inside a bunker in that apocalyptic world to be kept alive and stimulated.

The core purpose of "Project Constellation" is thus unveiled: it is a therapeutic simulation. By participating in the creation and inhabitation of a new world, the player provides invaluable brain data through the BCI. This data is essential for understanding their condition and, potentially, bringing them back from their coma. The game's progression from a simple text adventure to a complex, multi-genre simulation is narratively justified by the gradual improvement and calibration of the BCI, which can only transmit experiences of increasing complexity over time. The central promise of the game is to first create a universe, and then to step into it and live within that creation. This is represented diegetically through the BCI's "bandwidth," a visible meter that gates the complexity of the simulation's systems and UI, with new features being unlocked through narrative calibration beats.

To ensure the narrative is delivered effectively, the early game follows a clear loop: the player reads stories in their bunker room, the developer-character provides diegetic commentary on the project's progress between sessions, and the core reveals are sequenced for maximum impact.

#### **3\. The Player's Roles & Agency**

In Project Constellation, the player's agency is expressed through three distinct yet interconnected roles, allowing them to interact with the game across different narrative and strategic layers. The primary role is the **Meta-Avatar**, a digital reflection of the player themselves within the game's meta-narrative. This character exists in the "bunker" outside of the main simulation, engaging in real-time life-sim mechanics and serving as the vessel for all high-level meta-progression. It is through the Meta-Avatar that the player unlocks new features, blueprints, and capabilities for the simulation itself expanding on ideas from the meta-progression of rogue-likes.

The second role is that of **The God**. This is the player's initial form of interaction with the simulation, granting them the power to sculpt the planet, establish its fundamental rules, and guide the dawn of history from a high-level perspective. This role is most prominent in the early stages, functioning like a world-builder and history simulator; as the simulation matures and life develops, the player's direct control as a god diminishes, having "trained" the world's foundational principles. 

Finally, the player directly engages with the world through **Incarnated Characters**. This allows the player to "step into the world they created" by possessing and controlling individual NPCs within the simulation. They can inhabit a character for a brief period or for its entire lifespan, eventually establishing a primary lineage of "main characters" to experience the world through generations. The player's control scales from a single individual to managing parties, and eventually, entire organizations and nations, with the Meta-Avatar's progression directly influencing the power and capabilities of these in-world incarnations.

This entire structure is governed by a unified system to ensure clarity and balance. Player control is managed through a central resource, or Agency Budget, which is spent to possess characters, manage parties, and issue large-scale commands. The capabilities of these roles, such as party size and direct control privileges, are gated by the BCI's bandwidth, the discovery of new Knowledge keywords within the simulation, many other things such as recruiting members to gain abilities at different levels of abstraction.

### **Part II: Gameplay Systems & Mechanics**

#### **4\. The Two Worlds: Meta vs. Simulation**

Project Constellation's gameplay is fundamentally divided into two distinct but deeply interconnected spheres: the **Meta-Game** and the **Simulation Game**.

The **Meta-Game** takes place within the narrative's bunker, focusing on the player's Meta-Avatar. This sphere operates in real-time, aligned with the real-world clock, and includes optional idle and life-sim mechanics where the avatar follows a schedule and progresses even when the player is offline. This is the exclusive domain of the game's overarching progression system. What was initially termed the "Roguelike Front-End" is, in fact, this meta-layer of perpetual progression, where the player unlocks iterative blueprints, new game features, functions, and cosmetic options for the simulation. It is the command center from which the player expands the very rules and tools they can use in the world they are building. This offline progression is handled by a deterministic Away-Time Resolver, which simulates the avatar's schedule and provides the player with a summary of events upon their return.

The **Simulation Game** is the core creative sandbox—a persistent, planet-sized world that the player actively shapes and inhabits. Unlike the meta-game, time in the simulation is tick-based, and its flow is directly controlled by the player; there are no idle mechanics here. This world is designed as a systemic, emergent sandbox governed by ECS (Entity Component System) principles, where the player's actions, from crafting a tool to building a city, have meaningful consequences. It is within this simulation that the player performs actions, makes discoveries, and meets the conditions necessary to earn the unlocks that are then formalized in the Meta-Game. The core loop involves delving into the Simulation to achieve new milestones, then returning to the Meta-Game to unlock new potential, which is then brought back into the Simulation for even greater creative expression. All of this occurs a planetary timeline starting with planet formation through the entire arc of civilization.

#### **5\. Core World Systems**

The simulation world in Project Constellation is built upon a foundation of core systems designed for persistence, emergence, and scalability. 

* **EDIT THIS PARAGRAPH-INACCURATE** "The guiding principle is "elegant depth," where a few simple, reusable mechanics combine to produce rich, complex outcomes. At the heart of this is the **Unified Resource System**, a set of six core tokens—Time, Energy, Materials, Knowledge, Influence, and Population—that act as a universal language across all genres and scales. An action at one layer generates or consumes these tokens, creating consequences that ripple through all other layers; for example, Knowledge discovered in the text-RPG layer directly unlocks new construction options in the city-builder layer."

The world itself is data-driven, with all entities from biomes to items to creatures defined as tagged data. This modular approach allows for a high degree of procedural generation and systemic interaction, which is critical for emergenet, combinatorial experiences along with alinging with solo-developer feasibility. Player interaction with these systems is designed to be deeply diegetic; the world explains itself, and discovery is a core mechanic. A complex discovery system, expanding on concepts like Skyrim's alchemy, is applied to all aspects of the game—including abstract concepts and practices—allowing players to unlock new possibilities by experimenting with the environment. This process is formalized through a system of Idea Alchemy, where players can systemically combine materials, methods, and abstract concepts to produce new recipes, practices, and technologies. This system follows a clear grammar, allowing players to combine elements such as [Material] + [Method] + [Concept] to generate a new recipe, practice, or technology. Acquiring knowledge through these methods will be a pre-requisite for all expansion of the experience.

Crucially, every action is permanent. The simulation operates on a single, **Canonical Timeline**, where nothing is throwaway. Each genre layer reads the state of the world left by the previous layers and adds its own persistent artifacts. This ensures a true sense of history and consequence, where the valley a player carves in the god game is the same one their character later inhabits in the RPG.

#### **6\. The Genre Ladder: A Progression of Lenses**

The core structure of Project Constellation is the "Genre Ladder," a sequence of gameplay layers that function as distinct "lenses" through which the player interacts with their persistent world. Each new step on the ladder introduces a new genre's mechanics and perspective without discarding the previous layers. This progression is designed to mirror the history of both games and civilization, moving from abstract text to embodied characters, and from small survival groups to globe-spanning empires.

The journey begins with the most primitive forms of digital interaction: a **Digital Novel** and **Text RPG** that establish the world's foundational myths, lore, and map seeds. This evolves into a **God Simulation**, where the player sculpts the planet's terrain and establishes its rules from above. From there, the player "steps into the world" by incarnating into a character, engaging with layers like **CRPG/WRPG**, **Survival-Crafting**, and even small-scale **Immersive Sim** physics interactions.

As the character gathers allies, the game introduces **Party-Based RPG** and **Turn-Based Tactics** mechanics for small-squad encounters. This naturally scales to a **Colony Simulation**, where the player manages a settlement with needs, jobs, and hazards, punctuated by **Tower Defense** style events. As the colony grows into a city and then a nation, the lens zooms out again, incorporating **Construction & Management**, **City Builder**, and **Tycoon** elements. Finally, large-scale conflicts and global politics are handled through **Auto-Battlers**, **4X Strategy**, **Turn-Based Strategy**, and a fully abstracted **Grand Strategy** layer. Every layer reads the persistent world state created by the ones before it, ensuring a cohesive and unbroken history shaped entirely by the player.

#### **7\. Character & Faction Systems**

The inhabitants of the simulation are its living core, functioning as both autonomous individuals and as potential vessels for the player's agency. Every character, from the initial settlers to the leaders of nations, is simulated with their own needs, traits, schedules, and personal arcs, drawing from deep life-sim mechanics. This creates a dynamic and inhabited world where NPCs live their own lives, offering unique interactions and emergent stories.

A central pillar of the player's long-term engagement is the **Lineage System**. Rather than focusing on a single immortal hero, the player establishes a primary lineage of "main characters," guiding their family line through generations. This creates a persistent connection to the world's history as individual characters are born, live, and die. The player's meta-progression directly enhances the capabilities of the characters they inhabit, creating a powerful link between the two worlds. This generational story is initiated with a unique, isolated survival-in-nature vignette, tying the start of the player's primary lineage directly to the Survival-Crafting layer of the game.

This system is designed to scale organically. The player begins by controlling a single character but can soon recruit allies into a party, leveraging complex synergies and mutual training systems to develop a capable squad. This party forms the nucleus of a larger organization, which can grow into a faction and eventually a nation of hundreds of thousands. To foster a deep attachment to these individuals, characters are designed with a "collection" feel; each is unique, belonging to a specific race and lineage with their own history, making them feel like valuable and distinct assets like a collection of Pokemon or GI Joe.

#### **8\. Construction, Crafting, & Economy**

The economic and industrial development of the player's civilization is a core pillar of gameplay that scales dramatically across the Genre Ladder. It begins at the individual level with a deep **Survival-Crafting** system, where the first inhabitants gather raw materials from the procedurally generated world to create primitive tools and shelters. This layer features an enormous and expansive crafting tree, encouraging discovery and experimentation.

As the player's society grows, these individual crafting processes evolve into organized industry. Players can create **Blueprints** for standard designs, allowing for the efficient replication of items and buildings. This forms the basis for the **Construction & Management** layer, where logistics, resource transportation, and the management of the construction process itself become critical to success. Mastering these systems allows the player to tame the wilderness and expand their territory.

This economic simulation matures into a full-fledged **City Builder** and **Tycoon** experience. At the city level, players manage zoning, utilities, and infrastructure. At the macro level, they engage with sophisticated market dynamics, establishing firms, managing complex supply chains, and navigating price fluctuations. This multi-layered economic engine provides a clear progression from a single character surviving in the wild to a captain of industry directing a global economic empire.

#### **9\. Conflict & Resolution**

Conflict in Project Constellation is managed through a suite of scalable "Resolution Engines," where the game intelligently selects the appropriate system based on the number of combatants involved. This ensures that every conflict, from a small skirmish to a global war, is handled with a mechanically appropriate level of detail and player agency.

The foundational layer for all character action is a universal **Turn-Based Tactics (TBT)** system. Inspired by classics like X-Com (1994), this system governs not only small-squad combat but every action a character takes, creating a tactical economy of movement and action points for tasks as varied as fighting, crafting, or cooking. For defensive scenarios, a **Tower Defense** system allows players to create pre-set plans that coordinate structures, personnel, and materials, which are automatically executed during raids and disasters, incentivizing territorial control.

As the scale of conflict grows, the engines become more abstract. Mid-scale battles involving hundreds of combatants are resolved efficiently through an **Auto-Battler**, where the player's focus shifts from direct control to strategic preparation, unit composition, and synergies. For the largest engagements involving thousands of troops, a classic **Turn-Based Strategy (TBS)** engine is used, focusing on high-level operational concerns like supply lines, attrition, and multi-turn maneuvers.

### **Part III: Presentation & Player Experience**

#### **10\. Art, Presentation, & Game Views**

Project Constellation's presentation is guided by a principle of scalable clarity, where the visual and interactive layers are designed to be readable and evolve with the game's complexity. The primary perspective is **top-down**, potentially with a 3/4 angle pending tests, chosen for its efficiency with procedural systems and its ability to clearly convey tactical and strategic information. The art style is a hybrid, using textured environments on a grid-based map, while key objects like characters are rendered as 3D models from a locked perspective. This technical approach is complemented by emotive 2D character portraits to build a stronger bond between the player and the world's inhabitants.

Player interaction with the world is managed through **Five Primary Game Views**, each corresponding to a different scale of play. The **Tactical View** is the most zoomed-in, used for direct character control with a visual clarity comparable to *Rimworld* as objects and rooms need that level of detail as we want the player immersed and able to interact with objects etc. As the player's influence grows, they can seamlessly zoom out to a **Local View** for gameplay at the scale of cities, a **Regional View** for managing territories, a **Continental View** for grand strategy, and finally a fully abstracted **Global View** for a comprehensive perspective. strategy.

Crucially, the aesthetic fidelity of the simulation is not static. Mirroring the game's narrative and mechanical progression, every view and visual element will initially be presented in the simplest, most abstract form possible. Through meta-game progression, the player will unlock incremental upgrades, enhancing the world with better textures, more detailed models, and more sophisticated visual effects, allowing them to visibly witness their simulation grow in complexity and beauty over time. This makes modular systems for graphics essential.

Specifically, the Tactical View will use a textured art style rather than a sprite-based one. It will feature textured environments on its grid, with 3D models for characters and key props rendered as impostors to maintain performance. This is supported by z-level overlays for height, voxel-style cross-sections for digging, and ambient decals to make the world feel more lived-in. A major goal of the project is to make the player feel like they are creating a living world that they can view up close and almost view as painting they created on a canvas.

#### **11\. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)**

The UI/UX design for Project Constellation is founded on the principles of consistency, clarity, and respect for the player's cognitive load and time. The core of this approach is a **"Unified Grammar"** that applies across every genre layer. This means that core actions, terminology, and iconography retain their meaning regardless of scale; the verb "Inspect" functions similarly whether examining an item in a character's inventory or a power grid in a city, creating an intuitive and learnable experience.

To manage the game's immense eventual complexity, the onboarding process is designed to introduce **"one new idea at a time."** This gradual unveiling of mechanics is supported by contextual tooltips and diegetic hints that are woven into the world itself. This philosophy extends to mitigating player overwhelm by providing smart defaults and making complex features like idle mechanics optional. In fact, every facet of the game should start from the simplest foundations and the player should get to experience each element in  it's own unique space as it comes online for methodical but constantly steady, ever-expanding game.

Finally, the design is built with deep **"Session Respect."** The game will feature micro-goals designed for short, satisfying 10-15 minute play sessions, and the ability to quick-save anywhere ensures that players can easily engage with the game without needing to commit to long periods of time. Given the complexity of the game, a key concern is creating smaller packages of gameplay that will satisfying as a standalone accomplishment. These can be strung together for longer sessions.

This user-centric philosophy will be applied to the strategic game design in that the player should be able to reasonable estimate outcomes given their level of in-game expertise etc. If outcomes feel random, we are losing the experience we want to create. That does not mean everything needs to be fully telegraphed in early stages of mastery.

#### **12\. Audio Design**

The audio design for Project Constellation follows the same "unified grammar" as the rest of its systems, prioritizing clear player feedback and thematic consistency. The soundscape is designed to be "feedback-first," ensuring that player actions are always accompanied by satisfying and informative audio cues. The musical approach will be completely in-game as NPCs will create music and a whole industry will emerge allowing the player to fully immersively experience music. Long term plans inlcude a music creation mini-game at the meta-level in the bunker experience.

### **Part IV: Production & Development**

#### **13\. Technical Framework & Architecture**

The technical foundation of Project Constellation is an **engine-agnostic** design built for solo-developer feasibility and decades-long scalability as much as feasible while still depending on the engine for certain functions where independence is less required like rendering for instance etc. Unity 6 LTS will be used as the engine to deliver the game. The core architecture is based on **Entity Component System (ECS)** principles and reusable frameworks, which are ideally suited for managing the immense number of interacting elements in a highly systemic and emergent world. The design is broken down into a series of distinct, modular components. The architecture is broken down into modular components such as a History & Lineage Engine; a Planet Streaming & Chunking system for performance; a suite of "Maker" systems like the Blueprint Studio; and specific rendering solutions like a Top-Down Tile Renderer and Model Impostor Batcher. Modding tools and development frameworks should be made and used and eventually even unlocked as part of the game experience all in narrative as a late stage ability etc.

To ensure efficient content creation, the project utilizes a simple but powerful data pipeline. Game content such as items, recipes, and biomes will be defined in straightforward data tables (like CSV or JSON), which are then processed by importers to generate game-ready prefabs. This data-driven approach minimizes bespoke content work and maximizes reusability. For quality assurance, the testing strategy will rely on simulation seeds and deterministic replays, allowing for the consistent reproduction and debugging of complex emergent behaviors.

#### **14\. Development Roadmap & Release Plan**

The decades-long development of Project Constellation is structured into a series of shippable **Release Packages (RPs)**. Each package is a self-contained project that delivers a specific cluster of genre layers, is independently playable, and provides the foundational state for the next package in the sequence. This "feed-forward" approach ensures that development is incremental, manageable for a solo developer, and results in regular, satisfying releases for players.

The roadmap begins with **RP-0: Seed & Word**, which establishes the core text-based and statistical foundations of the world. Subsequent packages layer on new dimensions of gameplay, from **RP-1: World from Above** (God Game) and **RP-2: Step Into the World** (CRPG) to **RP-4: Founding the Settlement** (Colony Sim) and beyond, culminating in **RP-10: Region & World** (4X/Grand Strategy). To ensure quality and a clear definition of "done," each package must pass through four distinct quality gates: **Playtestable**, **Content-Complete**, **Stabilized**, and finally, **Certified**.

In all actuality, even these packages will be divided into even smaller releasable packages until atomic level packages are produced.

#### **15\. Scope, Risks, & Mitigations**

To ensure the decades-long development of Project Constellation remains feasible for a solo developer, a strict set of scoping principles and risk mitigation strategies have been established. The primary rule is to prioritize **systems over content**, focusing on creating robust, reusable patterns rather than bespoke, one-off experiences although those will be sprinkled in with eah release. The entire development process is built around clarity and avoiding fidelity until the core mechanics are proven, with a "graybox everything" approach in the early stages of each release package.

The most significant identified risks are feature sprawl, the complexity of maintaining a persistent world state, developer burnout, and overwhelming the player. Each risk has a corresponding mitigation strategy. **Feature sprawl** is countered by setting hard caps on the number of new mechanics per layer and requiring a formal review for any additions. **Persistence complexity** is managed by defining a lean "World State API" that strictly governs how data is passed between layers. **Developer burnout** is addressed by working in clearly defined "area slices" with checklists and alternating between high and low-complexity tasks. Finally, **player overwhelm** is mitigated through the optionality of complex systems, smart defaults, and a gradual unlocking of new features.

More granular risks are also being tracked. The risk of performance issues at a planetary scale is mitigated by aggressive streaming and LOD systems. Permadeath fatigue from the lineage system is countered by strong legacy carryovers and meta-currency to reroll heirs. The potential for offline clock exploits in the meta-game is mitigated by focusing rewards on knowledge rather than farmable currency. Finally, to prevent creative paralysis, the game will provide curated starter kits and "recipe cards" for common designs.

#### **16\. Success Criteria**

The ultimate success of Project Constellation will be measured by only by the quality of the process. The project will be considered successful if each individual **Release Package** is not only a satisfying, standalone game but also meaningfully **enriches** the packages that follow it. The most critical metric is for me to feel I have considered everything as I design and release bits of the experience while combining and synthesizing the best things I find and create for the ultimate experience and expression of that slice of the experience. Finally, on a production level, success means maintaining a development cadence that allows for the continual shipping of **small, satisfying slices** for years to come, ensuring the "genre ladder" is a sustainable and ever-growing endeavor.
