I built **Master Technical Plan v3.0** and put the full document in the canvas on the right. It’s engineered for decades-scale, with the two-process Sim/Presentation split, deterministic core, regionized planet streaming, event-sourced saves + snapshots, replay/chaos testing, a hardened Plugin SDK (capability manifests + optional WASM sandbox), and the full tooling suite (Inspector, Perf HUD, Flight Recorder, Crash-to-Replay, Plan Maker).

### Where your unique ideas are preserved (highlights)

* **Meta-Game vs Simulation Game** (away-time resolver in meta; tick-based sim) → baked into product–architecture contract and time domains.&#x20;
* **Roles & Agency** (Meta-Avatar, God, Incarnations; Agency Budget; BCI bandwidth gating) → modeled as global control/resource limits and unlock gates.&#x20;
* **Five Primary Views** with fidelity upgrades over time → implemented as RenderIntent adapters + unlockable fidelity ladder.&#x20;
* **Diegetic Modding / “Maker” tools** → represented by the Plan Maker pipeline using the same import→bake path the engine uses.&#x20;
* **Persistence with versioned schemas & migrations** → elevated to event-sourced saves + snapshots + Save Doctor recovery.&#x20;

If you want, I can also drop a Markdown copy into your repo folder, add a release-ready ADR template, or spin up the **M0** work items as a task checklist.
