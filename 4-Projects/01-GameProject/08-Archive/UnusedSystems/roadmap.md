## Phase 0 Objectives
- [U-106] This idea for a universal template for text docs needs exploration.
- [U-070] A system is needed to organize and store these files.
- [U-096] The drafts from past efforts are not in a proper database, and these existing items need to be incorporated strategically.
- [U-116] A prompt system is needed to clean up writing for grammar and spelling only.
- [U-171] Prior work on the computer and office setup should be reconsidered as part of Phase 0.
- [U-170] These content ideas should be implemented as soon as feasible after the "meta" phase.
