Absolutely—Pillar 6 is the perfect place to make music a first-class *system*, not just a pile of tracks. And yes: the narrative engine approach you drafted ports cleanly to music. Think of an **Axiom Audio Engine** that mirrors your story framework: clear pillars, a grammar, a planner/justifier, and reliable realization—so by the time components are slotted in, the *ideas* of the score are complete and consistent; the remaining craft is sound design and mix. &#x20;

* **6.1. The Sonic Identity**  
  * **6.1.1.** The Core Question: "What does this universe sound like?"  
  * **6.1.2.** The Pillars of Audio: Music Philosophy, Sound Effects (SFX) Language, and Ambient World-Building.  
* **6.2. The Cinematic Philosophy**  
  * **6.2.1.** The Role of Cinematics: Their purpose within the narrative and gameplay experience (e.g., "Storytelling," "Reward," "Atmosphere").  
  * **6.2.2.** The Visual Language of Cinematics: The guiding principles for direction, editing, and tone.

# Axiom Audio Engine — high-level blueprint

## 1) Sonic Charter (your “universe canon” for sound)

Define what your universe sounds like before you compose a note: tunings/modes, instrument families, timbral palette, diegetic vs. non-diegetic rules, mixing philosophy, and ambience strata. This ties directly to Pillar 6’s mandate to define the project’s identity in sound and motion, and to articulate a “Sonic Identity.”&#x20;

**Deliverables:**

* Palette spec (core/aux instruments, synthesis types, allowed effects).
* Modal & harmonic canon (keys/modes/scales per faction/biome/era).
* Mix/space doctrine (dynamic range, reverb families, headroom targets).

## 2) Music Grammar (rules of composition)

Just like your plot grammar and beat taxonomy, encode musical “operators” and legal sequences: cadence → modulation → develop motif → drop → rebuild → cadence. Include harmonic, rhythmic, textural, and timbral grammars.

**Operators (examples):**

* **Harmonic:** tonicize(x), modal\_shift(dorian↔aeolian), deceptive\_cadence()
* **Rhythmic:** halve\_tempo(), polymeter(3:2), groove\_switch(“march”→“motorik”)
* **Timbral:** thin\_orchestration(), double\_with\_transients(), filter\_swell()
* **Motivic:** invert(motifA), augment(motifB), counterpoint(motifA, motifC)

This is the audio analog of your “Narrative Grammar” box.&#x20;

## 3) Asset Library (the musical component catalog)

Maintain a library of **motifs**, **progression recipes**, **groove kits**, **textures**, **hitpoints/stingers**, and **stems**—all small, reusable assets you can slot into frameworks, exactly like your narrative components.&#x20;

**Schema sketch (symbolic, JSON-ish):**

```json
{
  "motif_id": "faction.alpha.main",
  "notes": "0, +3, +5, +7",
  "scale": "dorian",
  "rhythm_cells": ["3+3+2", "2+2+3+3"],
  "allowed_transforms": ["invert", "augment", "retrograde", "mode_shift"],
  "orchestration_tags": ["low_strings","bamboo_flutes","granular_pads"]
}
```

## 4) Planner & Justifier (the “algorithmic brain”)

Feed **intent** (target emotion/tension, POV, gameplay state), **seeds** (which motifs/biomes), and an **availability set** (which modules are legal in this context). A constraint solver/search builds candidate musical skeletons (sections, keys, textures) that satisfy canon + intent; every choice carries a *why* (e.g., “mode\_shift to Dorian because tension target up and faction=Alpha”). This maps 1:1 with your narrative engine’s planning/justification loop. &#x20;

**Inputs:**

* **Intent Spec:** tension curve, valence, energy, prominence, diegetic flag.
* **World State:** biome, time-of-day, faction presence, player risk, pace.
* **Availability:** allowed motifs, operators, instruments (respect Sonic Charter).

## 5) Synthesis & Realization (from plan to audio)

Turn the planned skeleton into **sections → phrases → bars → events**. Render by:

* **Adaptive arrangement** (choose stems/layers and orchestrations).
* **Symbolic → audio** (MIDI to synths/samplers) for generative cues.
* **Transitions** (x-fades, hitpoint stingers, pre-baked/real-time modulations).

This mirrors your “Arc Builder / Beat Sequencer / Scene Capsules → Realizer” path, just for music.&#x20;

## 6) Evaluation & QA (make it reliable)

Automated lints + property tests: no key clashes, motif misuse, dynamic ceiling respected; coverage metrics for **leitmotif presence**, **tension waveform**, **texture diversity**. Direct analog of your story lints/coverage.&#x20;

## 7) Versioning & Provenance (decades-ready)

Version not only the assets but also the **relationships** (motif↔character, motif↔faction, operator grammars, solver policies). Keep lineage for every cue (seed → operator choices → stems). When your canon evolves, a **content archaeology** routine can auto-migrate old cues (e.g., re-orchestrate motif α to new palette). Directly parallel to your narrative plan.&#x20;

## 8) Runtime Modes (how it deploys)

* **Batch**: render full cues for cinematics/trailers.
* **Interactive/Live**: time-sliced adaptation to gameplay; lock harmonic spine, let micro-textures react.
* **Hybrid**: stem grid + light generative overlays.&#x20;

# How this clicks with Pillar 6

Pillar 6 asks, “What does this universe sound like?” and splits audio into **Music Philosophy**, **SFX Language**, and **Ambient World-Building**. Your Axiom Audio Engine formalizes the **Music Philosophy** piece—giving you a charter, grammar, planner, and assets that can scale for decades and stay coherent with your world and cinematics.&#x20;

---

# Minimal, practical starting kit (solo-friendly)

**Week 1 (atomized into daily packages):**

1. **Sonic Charter v0.1** — palette, 3 modes, 1 “mix doctrine” page.&#x20;
2. **Motif Pack A** — 3 leitmotifs (world, faction, protagonist) with allowed transforms.
3. **Progression Recipes** — 4 harmonic operators + 2 cadence patterns.
4. **Groove Kits** — 2 tempo families, 3 rhythm cells each.
5. **Operator Library v0.1** — 10 musical operators (names + pre/postconditions).
6. **Intent DSL v0.1** — {tension, valence, energy, focus, diegetic}.
7. **Prototype Planner** — rule table mapping intent → operator sequences (even a spreadsheet is fine).

**Simple “recipe” example:**

* **Intent:** tension↑ to 0.7, valence≈0, energy medium, non-diegetic, biome=“frozen steppe”.
* **Plan:** motif α (dorian) → develop (augment) → modal\_shift (phrygian) → textural swell → deceptive\_cadence.
* **Realize:** low strings + flutes + granular pad; 100 BPM; polymeter 3:2 on percussion; plate verb cap at -18 LUFS short-term.

---

# Bonus: narrative ↔ music handshake

* **Leitmotif binding:** each narrative entity/beat type gets a motif/operator set (e.g., “reversal” → inversion + deceptive cadence).
* **Hitpoint API:** story events emit “beats” (setup/turn/reveal) → music operators with guards.&#x20;
* **Provenance mirror:** a scene capsule links to a cue capsule (which motif, which transforms, why).&#x20;

---

If you like this shape, I can draft:

* a 1-page **Sonic Charter** template,
* a **Music Operator** spec (pre/postconditions), and
* a tiny **Intent→Plan** rule table you can start using immediately.

That’ll give you a computational spine for music that fits cleanly under Pillar 6 and harmonizes with your Axiom Engine. &#x20;

CINEMATICS SECTION

got you — let’s make cinematics a first-class **system** that *pulls directly from your narrative engine* and scales from 60-second shorts to 15-minute features.

# Axiom Cinematics Engine (ACE)

## 0) Goal in one line

Given a **Narrative Scene Capsule** + **Intent** (tension curve, POV, tone, beats), the system assembles a **cinematic plan** (shots, blocking, camera, lighting, transitions) that you can previz fast, render cleanly, and iterate safely over decades.

---

## 1) Cinematic Charter (your “visual canon”)

Lock identity before content.

* **Framing & format:** aspect ratio(s), safe-area, lens kit (e.g., 24/35/50/85mm), sensor/crop, frame rates.
* **Color & texture:** LUT families, film response curves, grain/vignette policy, palette bindings per faction/biome/era.
* **Movement doctrine:** when handheld is allowed, max move speed, parallax targets, drift tolerances.
* **Lighting grammar:** key types (motivated/unmotivated), key\:fill\:rim ratios by mood, practicals policy, fog/atmos volume ranges.
* **Continuity rules:** 180°/30° rules, eyeline policy, match-on-action, motivated cut vs graphic match preference.
  Deliverable: a 1–2 page “Cinematic Bible v0.1”.

---

## 2) Cinematic Grammar (operators & legal sequences)

Like your story/music grammars, codify the **operators** the planner can use:

**Shot operators**
`establish(location)`, `anchor(subject)`, `ots(subject,target)`, `push_in(subject)`, `track_parallel(subject)`, `orbit(subject)`, `insert(prop)`, `pov(subject)`, `reveal(subject,method)`, `cutaway(topic)`.

**Blocking operators**
`triangle(subjectA,subjectB,subjectC)`, `stack_depth(subjects,front→back)`, `cross(subjects)`, `converge(to_mark)`.

**Lighting operators**
`key_from(direction,intensity)`, `rim(tint,intensity)`, `practical(color,temp)`, `motivated_bounce(surface)`.

**Transition operators**
`cut_on_action()`, `match_graphic(shape/color)`, `whip_pan(direction)`, `L_cut(audio_lead)`, `J_cut(audio_lag)`, `dip_to(color)`.

**Constraints / pre-postconditions examples**

* `pov(x)` requires prior `anchor(x)` in last N shots.
* `reveal(x)` increases “information delta” metric; lock camera until comprehension ≥ threshold.
* `orbit()` barred when “somber” + “military” unless intent requests disorientation.

---

## 3) Asset Library (reusable building blocks)

* **Shot templates:** parameterized ECS-style prefabs (camera rig, focal length, height, offset, dolly/boom path).
* **Block patterns:** 2- and 3-character staging patterns (A↔B OTS dance, triangle authority, power-axis swaps).
* **Lighting templates:** “noir high-contrast”, “soft morning”, “industrial sodium”, each with tweakable ranges.
* **Transition kits:** pre-rigged camera moves & timing curves for common joins.
* **Performance capsules:** facial/gesture beats (nod, micro-flinch, hold-breath) you can trigger deterministically or sample.

> Minimal v0.1: 12 shot templates (WS/MS/CU/ECU/OTS/POV/Insert/Establish/Tracking/Push-in/Crane-up/Static), 6 lighting looks, 6 transitions, 6 block patterns.

---

## 4) Planner & Justifier (turn narrative into pictures)

**Inputs from Narrative Engine:**

* Beat list with labels (setup, turn, reveal, escalation, payoff), **POV**, **stakes**, **tension waveform**, **information deltas**, **entities** (characters/props/locations), and **tone**.

**Search/constraint process:**

1. **Map beats → shot intents** (e.g., *reveal* → `anchor→pov→reveal`).
2. **Select shot chains** that satisfy charter & constraints (lens, movement doctrine, continuity).
3. **Assign blocking & lighting** based on POV, status dynamics, and tone.
4. **Thread transitions** to meet pacing (average shot length, variance, rhythmic sync if music is present).
5. **Justify** every choice (traceable “because” graph).

**Guard rails:**

* **Continuity lints:** 180° violations, eyeline flips, spatial jumps > threshold without re-establish.
* **Readability tests:** face visibility %, silhouette contrast, motion vector clash.
* **Complexity budget** (see §6): ensures a 1–15 min film fits solo capacity.

---

## 5) Realization Pipeline (solo-friendly)

* **Textboards → Thumbnails:** auto layout beat text under 16:9 frames; you sketch thumbnails over it.
* **Animatic:** auto-time shots to target **ASL** (average shot length) & tension curve; drop temp VO/SFX.
* **Layout/Blocking:** place proxies, apply block patterns, run a “path smoother” for camera rails.
* **Lighting pass:** stamp a look template, tweak key/practical placement.
* **Render:** real-time in-engine or quick Cycles/Eevee/Path-traced batches depending on scene class.
* **Conform:** assemble to timeline, apply transitions, auto-mix stems (music handshake below).

---

## 6) Complexity Budgeting (so you finish)

Assign **Shot Complexity Points (SCP)**; cap per runtime to keep work tractable.

| Feature                                 | Points |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Extra character on screen               | +1     |
| Complex move (orbit/crane/whip)         | +2     |
| VFX/sim element (smoke/cloth/particles) | +2     |
| Crowds (>5)                             | +3     |
| Complex lighting (volumetrics/haze)     | +2     |
| New location setup                      | +3     |
| Non-dialog action (fight, chase)        | +3     |

**Budgets (suggested):**

* 60–90s: 25–30 SCP
* 3–5 min: 90–110 SCP
* 10–15 min: 250–320 SCP

The planner chooses alternatives (e.g., `push_in` instead of `orbit`) to stay within budget while honoring intent.

---

## 7) Versioning & Provenance (decades-ready)

* Version **shot templates**, **blocking patterns**, **lighting looks**, and **constraint policies**, not just media.
* Keep a **Shot Graph**: each node = shot instance with seed assets + operator stack + parameters + justifications.
* **Content archaeology** migration: when the charter evolves (new palette/lenses), auto-retarget old shots by re-solving operator stacks under new constraints.

---

## 8) Runtime Modes

* **Batch film**: fully rendered linear cutscenes/trailers.
* **In-engine real-time**: playbooks trigger shot stacks at runtime (dialog trees, in-world cinematics).
* **Hybrid**: prerendered plates + in-engine overlays (UI diegesis, holograms).

---

## 9) Handshakes (narrative, music, gameplay)

**Narrative → Cinematics**

* Narrative engine emits **Beat Events** with intent payloads → ACE consumes and proposes shot stacks.
* **POV contract**: if narrative POV changes, ACE must re-establish geography and update eyelines.
* **Exposition gating**: when information delta > threshold, ACE must slow ASL and increase anchor shots.

**Cinematics ↔ Music**

* ACE publishes a **tension curve & hitpoint map** (cut points, reveals, impacts).
* Axiom Audio Engine reads it for cue planning; ACE can request “L-cut/J-cut” behaviors or stingers.
* Shared **tempo grid** lets whip-pans/cuts sit on beats when desired.

**Cinematics ↔ Gameplay**

* If interactive, ACE exposes **interruptible points** and **safe joins** (places to resume a chain).

---

## 10) Data Schemas (lightweight & practical)

**Cinematic Intent (per beat)**

```json
{
  "beat_id": "scene12.beat4",
  "type": "reveal",
  "pov": "protagonist",
  "tension": 0.72,
  "valence": -0.1,
  "stakes": "personal",
  "info_delta": 0.6,
  "entities": ["protagonist","antagonist","artifact","guard"],
  "tone": "somber",
  "duration_hint": 6.0
}
```

**Shot Template (parametrized)**

```json
{
  "id": "ots_standard",
  "camera": {"focal_mm": 50, "height_m": 1.6, "azimuth_deg": 25, "distance_m": 1.0},
  "movement": {"type": "static"},
  "framing": {"subject": "A", "target": "B", "headroom_pct": 0.1, "lead_room_pct": 0.15},
  "constraints": ["respect_180", "ensure_eyeline"],
  "lighting_slots": ["key_left_soft","rim_right_cool","practical_warm"]
}
```

**Plan Output (excerpt)**

```json
{
  "scene_id": "scene12",
  "asl_target": 3.5,
  "shots": [
    {"tpl":"establish_city","dur":4.0,"why":["locate audience","lower cognitive load"]},
    {"tpl":"ots_standard","dur":3.0,"params":{"subject":"protagonist","target":"antagonist"}},
    {"tpl":"pov_close","dur":2.0,"why":["increase empathy","prep reveal"]},
    {"tpl":"insert_prop","dur":1.5,"params":{"prop":"artifact"},"transition":"match_graphic"}
  ],
  "scp_total": 27
}
```

---

## 11) QA & Lints (make it reliable)

* **Continuity**: 180°/30°, eyeline, screen-direction.
* **Readability**: face visibility %, silhouette contrast, subtitle safe-area.
* **Pacing**: ASL within band; variance pattern matches intent (calm → longer takes, chaos → shorter).
* **Coverage**: mandatory anchor/establish presence per scene.
* **Audio sync**: dialog beats aligned, music hitpoints respected.
* **Budget**: SCP ≤ cap; location resets counted.

---

## 12) Minimal starting kit (solo, week 1–2)

1. **Cinematic Bible v0.1** (format, lenses, color/lighting doctrine, movement rules).
2. **Template Pack**: 12 shots, 6 lighting looks, 6 transitions, 6 block patterns.
3. **Intent→Chain Table**: CSV mapping beat types to default shot chains (you can hand-edit).
4. **SCP spreadsheet**: auto-totals complexity; redline if over budget.
5. **Previz workflow**: thumbnails → animatic → layout in your tool of choice (UE/Unity/Blender).
6. **Two test scenes**: a 60–90s “dialogue + reveal” and a 60–90s “brief action turn.”

---

## 13) Scale path (1 → 15 minutes)

* **v0.1 (60–90s)**: 15–20 shots, 1–2 locations, ≤3 characters; static + push-in + OTS + insert.
* **v0.2 (3–5m)**: add 1 complex move per minute (track/orbit), 1 montage, 1 lighting change mid-scene.
* **v0.3 (10–15m)**: introduce parallel action motif, 2–3 location changes, 1 signature crane/vertical move, limited VFX class.

---

## 14) Where to start today (concrete next steps)

* Draft **Cinematic Bible v0.1** (I can give you a fill-in template next).
* Build the **Intent→Chain** CSV with 8 beat types × 3 default chains each.
* Make the **SCP sheet** and test it on your first 60–90s script.
* Block **Template Pack** in your engine/DCC as prefabs so the planner can spit out a shotlist you can drop in.

---

If you want, I’ll spin up:

* a 1-page **Cinematic Bible** template,
* the **Intent→Chain** CSV seed (with \~24 mappings),
* and a **Shot Template** JSON starter set.

You’ll then be able to feed a scene from your narrative engine and get a legit, budget-aware shot plan you can previz the same day.
