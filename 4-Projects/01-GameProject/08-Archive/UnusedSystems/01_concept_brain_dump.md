5) Genre-Ladder Progression (your sequence, professionally framed)

Each step adds a new lens while carrying forward world state.

1. Interactive Fiction (Text RPG) – Roleplay via text; establish myths, map seeds, first lore tokens.

This is really about being able to start as simple as possible. In fact I plan actually starting the whole experience with a pure digital novel with the most primitive presentation of the earliest computer readouts.

Then we will move forward to primitive interactive fiction, CYOA type mechanics, and finally more early text adventure type feeling. 

You probably need more of the story to make good sense of how we open as I want to be immersive right from the beginning. I am initially going to present the 'game' as one where you build a simulation in concert with "me". I am going to build the game right in front of the player's eyes with them. I will even acknowledge I am a complete novice so we are starting with the simplest foundation. I will tell them because of this, I cannot even offer a game yet but I will tell them a story.

I will time some time and lead to a big reveal, but the player is going to be told the life they think is real that they are living outside the game is an illusion creating by a brain computer interface to keep them "healthy" "stimulated" and "alive" during a coma. THey can actually help us understand their condition and possibly bring them back from the coma if they participate in building and acting in the simulation world. That is because they will provide brain data that will lead to unprecedented understanding of how the brain actually works as the brain computer interface becomes more and more conneceted to their mind. THAT Is why the game is actually starting so primitive. yes I am novice programmer but I can only send as much complexity of the experience ot them as the BCI will allow.

2. Life Sim (Stats Layer) – Needs/traits/time; introduce schedules and personal arcs.

This will start very primitively as the interactive fiction portion gets going. Over time, I want to build in as many facets of life simming as possible as building the simulation to be robust as a thing in itself is very important to me.

Also this is a good time to say the player is really has different character roles in this game.

For one, they will create a character that they will be encouraged to be a digital reflection of themselves. This character will progress in various ways and be the character that knows about the simulation and interacts with it outside of the sim. This ties into the roguelike features of front end progression etc.

They will also create a God that they will control to some extent-more in the beginning, less over time after "training" it somewhat.

They will also be able to jump in and out of controlling NPCs in the simulation that will be become a version of them for a time or the whole character's life. They can even form parties and organizations of these characters will restrictions on how much they can control at a given time.

3. Idle / Incremental Mechanics – Optional automation; background progression loops.

The player's meta-avatar is the concern in the early game. The character will age and do things outside the simulation world in a "bunker" they are trapped in with me as we work on the simulation world together. I will address the player as myself though I will really end of being a character in a apocolypse (the world where the player's real comatose body is in the lore).

All that being said, time will be in real-time for the meta-avatar. The player wil have to manage it's schedule according to the real world clock timing. When they are away the character will keep doing the schedule with things happenign to them etc and developing or regressing. 

I do not plan on having idle mechanics in the simulation world as the player will control when ticks are processed.

4. Roguelike Front-End – Procedural runs establish unlocks/blueprints for the world.

This is not about procedural runs at all. Once we create the world, the player will play in that space unless they wipe their file and start completely over with a new meta-profile etc. It's more about the player inhabiting NPCs over the timeline and building their meta-character in this meta progression system on par with the breath of Owlcat games etc. This inlcudes a knowledge keyword system to even build their brains etc. Side note they can progress character on their roster too and their meta-character progression will affect the controlled NPCs etc.

Everything for the simulation expansions will be done here although almost always achieved in sim. Think iterative blueprint, feature, function and comestic unlocks for a never ending sense of progression.

5. God Simulation (World Builder) – Sculpt terrain/biomes; place rules, resources, and high-level constraints.

This is going to be a little long as I should explain a little more about what the player is actually doing during the first digital novel phase of the game while we are getting to point where visuals and world (very abstracted at first with incremental upgrades unlocked over time) are getting built.

The player will be told at first about the digital novel phase of the game as work toward the simulation. They will told they are in bunker with me and I will talk to them at times about the present and what I am working towards (they can provide input unitl the IF phase at least). Then they will return to their room in the bunker and read stories I have provided. They think it will be fiction but it's secretly about the real world that "I" live where society has collapsed and also there real body that is in a coma is stored.

They will be reading about the society collapse and other events. The first reveal will be that the stories are all connected which won't be obvious at first. Then it will be revealed that the place where "I" live is not actually Earth, it's an yet to be named Earthlike planet. In fact, I actually live in the world being described in the stories!

Then the player will read about how society has pockets of tech. Some of these have slightly mroe advanced medical tech including primitive BCI. YOu can see from here we keep dripping clues to the how coma patients can be attached and stimulated to preserve their minds better etc. Then the player will realize, THEY ARE IN COMA etc etc. Now the real reason for the simulation becomes clear in a reality shattering reveal saying their "real" life is only created by the BCI!

At this point the text adventure we progress more and now we will begin to create the simulation universe space (inside the bunker). That will start the God portion of the game.

The god portion is like a dynasty, history simulator as well as a planet builder, sim-earth game. We essentially build the world space (super abstracted and early game tech looking and incrementally upgrade). They can start inhabiting proto man in text adventure with symbolic map type adventures as time moves forward and lineages develop. They will have the God role for now as well doing both things.

6. Creative Sandbox – Free build with low friction; validate systems toys (no fail pressure).

Great time to address how this game functions. It is a true sandbox in that it will be a whole plant to manipulate over time (granted in chunks and iterations but the end result could be enourmous after 50 years). That planet and the life on it will governed by systems that combine to create an enormous variety of emergent behaviors. Using ECS principles and resusable frameworks will only support this effort. I want a game I can play myself and enjoy just as much as someone who didnt make it.

This also means this game is meant to be creative act at all times with your world, story, characters, and even the planet itself including the multitidue of things you will be able to research, craft, and build on the planet not limited to infastructure, buildings, vehicles, and everything in between. Making blueprints for standard designs, creating cities and transportation infastructure literally shaping your local region at times and later the entire globe possibly with your creation and civilization.

7. Tabletop Mode (Top-Down Grid) – Board-like read of the world; prepares POV transition.

There is much to like about TT games especially mechanically. However, the main focus here is portraying the look of the world. With the size and scale of this project, I need the most efficent procedural system and to me that is a top-down perspective for the game using all the best practices to make the world less "cold" feeling that this view typically provides. I want to do procedural graphics where possible and top down is just too good for that. Plus we are running a tick based, tile system for map.

I plan on using 3D models for some things like characters and other key pieces but with a locked perspective just take advantage of modeling and coding etc. I will character portraits to enliven and build player bond with people etc. Z-levels will be used for vertically with indicators for height. Voxel like areas where digging is occuring etc.

Note this is really for the close-up and tactical view of the game when you are controlling invidual characters. You should be able to see objects clearly. Think the level of zoom out of Rimworld for this view BUT not that artstyle. 

We will be putting textures on things rather than sprites. 3/4 top down view might be considered if it really helps graphical immersion.

There are four main views in this game. This tactical level view, a view more at the city level, a view a the regional level, and a global view. Everyone of these views when first presented to the player will be in the simpliest possible format and presenatation we can devise and we will incrementally work out way towards nice textures and other enhancement effects all in due course and all unlocked and upgraded in the meta-game as we improve the simulation.

8. CRPG / WRPG (Incarnate) – Become a character inside the world you shaped; quests emerge from prior steps.

I already touched on how the meta-character it going to have this full set of unlocks that will probably be the most expansive unlock system in the history of gaming.

Well this genre here is to represent the coming online of being able to represent characters in the simulation. This will start with the very first "humans" and progress from there. As I said, lineage simulator so your characters will die, but eventually you can micro enough to make every character feel like it's worth your time to get to know them (of course the early history of planet will involve much time chunking).

Now another wrinkle, we will reach a point in the simulation where the meta-character will establish their own personal lineage and a series of "main" in-simulation characters passing from one successor to the next. They will also be able to spend some kind of yet designed resource of system of resources to take control of party members as well and other aspects of their organization.

To wrap up, we will explore and implement all the best things for a characters from this genre as well along with all the simulation and emergement aspects etc.

9. Survival-Crafting – Isolated start; gather/craft using materials from earlier world gen.

On the isolated start, this in the sense that once the planet is formed and we move through the biosphere eras to reach proto-humans, the first character the player will inhabit will be isolated to very small part of the planet while also experiencing the tactical view for the first time.

Survival mechanics will persist and grow only from the point in concert with the development of various RPG and life sim status effects and on.

Crafting will be the early type of manufacturing for colony level development. It will have a full collect resources, discover uses, set up crafting chains and assign tradesmen etc. The tree will be enoroumous of things that can be created of course but we can detail later.

There will also be a full mining, refining, transport manufacturing trade thing too but that comes more with the city level and such.

Oh at the beginning of the main character lineage we will have an isolated survival situation in nature to kick off that phase-all alone.

I think you can imply the rest of the application.

10. Immersive Sim (Physics-Driven) – Small-scale systems interplay (locks, power, fluids).

I understand immersive sim is usually kind of a first person experience. However, I want create use of materials and resources to always be an option. A sense that a solution is only a discovery away. We will support this will some kind of perception, discovery mini mode that I have yet to devise. Think a more complicated version of Skyrim's alchemy system applied to everything in the game including concpets and ideas and practices even to discover new things. This includes using things in environment to affect possibilities etc.

Of course, we want as much physics and realistic simulation anyway so this genre also fits well because of that.

11. JRPG Party Mechanics – Party comp, roles, ability synergies; narrative beats.

At first, the player will only be able to control a single character in the simulation for quite awhile in the early eras. Eventually they will be albe to recruit people to their party only being able to persuade them at first. Over a long process they can eventually control the person directly at the cost of other control forms etc.

There will be a complex system of the characters and NPCs providing synergies and training to each other on knowledge and practices creating a multitude of synergies and ability trading etc. 

As the meta-character grows in ability and access and control of the simulation, the party can grow to the size of an organization and even nation of characters under the characters influence. We are talking of going from tens, to hundreds, to thousands, to hundreds of thousands each with its own systems and features to effectively engage with each scale as supported by the other modes coming online later in the game.

Lastly, characters will have a little collection feel like GI Joe or Pokemon where each one is unique and part of a lineage and race with unique histories and things to offer the 'collection' this will be an important part of the game and how we drive player engagement with the world and characters.

12. Turn-Based Tactics (Small Squad) – Grid movement, cover, objectives; links to Tabletop.

Now this part was hard to place. There is the typical TBT systems that support tactical group combat etc. That will be a part of the game for sure.

The other main idea here though is that TBT concepts are going to govern all action. Think every unit an X-Com (94) like set of units they can move in given time and a host of actions pending on context in this case and what they know etc. Even cooking a meal is a tactical event in that the movement and action all have an economy with various resources and occurs in methodical, procedural fashion etc.

13. Colony Simulation – Settlers with needs; jobs, schedules, pathing, hazards.

Self explanatory. Much of these mechanics will be in the simulation structure already but this also player tuning etc. It will be more convincing and managing and commanding pending on the level of influence etc.

The colony mechanics will be abstracted across the world to simulate small scale, tactical level interactions for civilization.

Tower Defense (Colony Events) – Raids/disasters resolved via defensive builds.

Think of this like creating defense plans with some of being structure based and some just being plans that coordinate men and material. Then if you are attacked, you can have your militia, party, or military take up positions and defend automatically with some ability to direclty intervene by the player as well. Its not just colony though can occured anywhere that is unsecured etc leading to incentive to expand, claim, and secure more territory.

14. Open-World RPG – Leave the valley; world traversal, factions, light vehicles/mounts.

All the typical stuff. Though this is not a quick reaction game in any way and all tick based, mathematical movement etc. The world should still feel inhabited with characters able to be interacted with for unique dialoque across the world while living their lives.

All the other typical elements here implied by this genre and expansion of the game. The "open-world" can be experienced on all the different scales of the game all with varying levels of detail.

You may be able to see the strategic level of another country but you cannot zoom into it's tactical level without some kind of intelligence or presence in the area etc. Anywhere on planet can be accesssed with enough effort though.

15. Construction & Management Sim – Services, logistics, territory expansion.

Construction is a major aspect of this overall game. Not just simple construction either but managing your construction process well will be a major factor in larger scale succceses beyong say the party level. Building things tames the world as well.

I plan to try to build as many management systems as I can phase in over time starting with critical ones but ever thinking about the next one to add. I plan on having a mastery system too where at first you have to micro all the management to learn and engage with it but as you master you can delegate more and more while being more and more effective etc. I want to have services for everything I can get to so no limits on what could happen here and what we simulate.

16. City Builder – Zoning, traffic, utilities; policy knobs appear.

You can eventually start getting enough people in your "organization" that you can begin to form a City. Of course, your meta-character can only do some many things at once when inhabiting NPCs so you will varying levels of control and influence but it still will be all the classic city builder stuff with heavy reliance on creating unique designs one time and then blueprinting them to use them again and again when possible. The cities will get more complicated as things progress etc.

17. Tycoon / Business Sim – Markets, firms, supply chains, price dynamics.

Goes hand in hand with everything else and will get more sophiscated as time goes on of course.

18. Auto-Battler (Mid-Scale Conflicts) – Resolve mass skirmishes efficiently using builds/synergies.

Think settings things up both far in advance and close to teh battle and then seeing it play out with limited intervention. This would happen for conflicts that involves hundreds whereas tacitcal combat controlled by the player would involve less than 100. Battles involving thousands would go to turn based style.

19. 4X Strategy (Regional) – Found new cities; abstract map; diplomacy & exploration.

Builds on everything else to where you have your main city and you found another colony that eventually becomes your second city and so on. The early phase is tough to crack but then you can automate more and more to expand into a real country after a long grind and territorial expansion.

20. Turn-Based Strategy (Large Battles) – Operational combat over turns; attrition & supply.

Need this in various forms to support encounters with thousands or more.

21. Grand Strategy (Globe) – Fully abstracted world stage; ideology, treaties, catastrophes.

I wont linger here but think full globe scale games all Paradox. It would even be possible to dominate the whole world with high level controll of giant organziational machine you assembled iteration by iteration into this monster than can run a planet.
