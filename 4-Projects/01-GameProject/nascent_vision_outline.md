# **Nascent Vision & First Principles Sketch**

*This template is for the "phase-0" exploration of a long-term, life-scale project. It is not for writing a formal vision statement. Instead, it is a tool to sketch the foundational mindset, motivations, and questions when you don't yet understand enough to form a concrete vision. It prioritizes inquiry over answers.*

## **Part 1: Foundational Inquiry — The Bedrock 'Why'**

*Before a vision, there is a pull—a curiosity, a problem, a tension. This section is about defining that pull from first principles, independent of any solution.*

### **1\. The Core Problem, Question, or Tension**

*What is the fundamental "itch" you are trying to scratch? Describe the core problem you see, the central question you're obsessed with, or the tension you feel in the world. Articulate it without mentioning any product, service, or company.*

**My Inquiry:** \[e.g., "Why do people feel so disconnected despite being hyper-connected?" or "What does it mean to build a truly sustainable and self-sufficient community?" or "How can knowledge be structured so that it accelerates discovery instead of burying it?"\]

### **2\. The Personal Resonance — Why Me? Why This?**

*Projects of this scale are fueled by deep personal motivation. What is your unique connection to this inquiry? What experiences, passions, or frustrations make this your problem to explore?*

**My Connection:** \[e.g., "I've spent my career building social tools that left me feeling isolated," or "I grew up in a disposable culture and am searching for permanence and meaning."\]

### **3\. Bedrock Beliefs & Assumptions**

*What core beliefs do you hold about this domain? What are the underlying truths you are building upon? Listing them clarifies your starting point and exposes them for future questioning.*

* **Belief 1:** \[e.g., "I believe human beings have an innate need for creative expression."\]  
* **Belief 2:** \[e.g., "I believe that current economic models are fundamentally misaligned with long-term planetary health."\]  
* **Belief 3:** \[e.g., "I believe that the right tool can fundamentally change how a person thinks."\]

### **4\. The Landscape of Ignorance — What I Don't Know**

*At phase-0, what you don't know is more important than what you do. What are the biggest open questions? What are the "unknown unknowns" you suspect are lurking?*

**My Known Unknowns:** \[e.g., "I don't know if community can be designed or if it must emerge organically," or "I don't know what the key leverage point is for changing consumer behavior."\]

## **Part 2: Sketching the Direction — The 'What If'**

*This section moves from pure inquiry to imaginative exploration. The goal is not to set goals, but to paint impressionistic sketches of possible futures that could result from your inquiry.*

### **1\. The Idealized Future State**

*Forget feasibility. If your inquiry were successfully resolved, what would the world look and feel like? Describe a scene, a feeling, or a state of being. This is not a goal; it's a north star.*

**A Glimpse of the Future:** \[e.g., "A world where education is a lifelong, joyful pursuit, not a preparatory phase," or "A future where every object in our home has a story and is meant to last for generations."\]

### **2\. Guiding Principles of Operation**

*How will you conduct this exploration? These are not corporate values, but personal rules of engagement for the project itself.*

* **Principle 1:** \[e.g., "Learn in public."\]  
* **Principle 2:** \[e.g., "Follow curiosity over obligation."\]  
* **Principle 3:** \[e.g., "Prioritize simplicity and subtract complexity."\]

### **3\. Potential Pathways (Exploratory, Not Prescriptive)**

*What are a few different forms this project could take? This avoids premature attachment to a single solution. Think of them as hypotheses to be tested over years.*

* **Path A:** \[e.g., "This could become a body of research and writing."\]  
* **Path B:** \[e.g., "This could become a physical place or community."\]  
* **Path C:** \[e.g., "This could become a set of software tools."\]

## **Part 3: The Nascent Vision — A Working Synthesis**

*This is a temporary, living statement that captures the current state of your thinking. It should feel active, not static. It is a guide for the next phase of learning.*

**My Working Hypothesis is that by exploring...**

\[**The Core Problem/Question**\]

**...guided by a deep personal connection to...**

\[**The Personal Resonance**\]

**...and operating by the principles of...**

\[**List Guiding Principles**\]

**...I might begin to build toward a future where...**

\[**The Idealized Future State**\]

**The very next question I need to explore is:**

\[e.g., "Who has tried to solve this before and what can I learn from their failures?" or "What is the smallest possible experiment I can run to test one of my bedrock beliefs?"\]
