# **Nascent Vision & First Principles Sketch (v2)**

*This template is for phase-0: a meta, first-principles sketch of a nascent idea before I know enough to state a proper vision. It is deliberately conceptual and high-level. I sit down and write from my mind as it is—beliefs, hunches, and contradictions—without adding detail debt. Nothing here is a commitment; everything is provisional and testable. The point is to externalize the sketch now so that time, learning, and good process can refine, improve, or replace it later*

## **Part 1: The 'Why' — Foundational Inquiry**

*This section defines the pull—the curiosity, problem, or tension—that fuels the project. This part should be relatively stable. If it changes frequently, that's a red flag.*

### **1\. The Core Problem, Question, or Tension**

*What is the fundamental "itch"? Describe the central question you're obsessed with or the tension you feel in the world, without mentioning any solution.*

**My Inquiry:** \[e.g., "Why do people feel so disconnected despite being hyper-connected?"\]

### **2\. The Personal Resonance — Why Me? Why This?**

*What is your unique connection to this inquiry? What experiences or frustrations make this your problem to explore?*

**My Connection:** \[e.g., "I've spent my career building social tools that left me feeling isolated."\]

### **3\. Bedrock Hypotheses (formerly Beliefs & Assumptions)**

*What are the underlying truths you are building upon? Phrase them as testable hypotheses.*

* **Hypothesis 1:** \[e.g., "I suspect that human beings have an innate need for creative expression that is currently unmet."\]  
* **Hypothesis 2:** \[e.g., "My working theory is that current economic models are misaligned with long-term planetary health."\]  
* **Hypothesis 3:** \[e.g., "I have a hunch that the right tool can fundamentally change how a person thinks."\]

## **Part 2: The 'What' — Sketching the Possibilities & Edges**

*This section is an impressionistic exploration of what could be. It uses scenes and guardrails to shape the direction without over-specifying the center.*

### **1\. The Idealized Future State (A Scene)**

*Forget feasibility. If your inquiry were resolved, what would the world look and feel like? Describe a tangible scene, a feeling, or a "day in the life."*

**A Glimpse of the Future:** \[e.g., "A world where education is a lifelong, joyful pursuit. A grandmother and her grandchild are learning side-by-side in a community workshop."\]

### **2\. The Anti-Vision (Failure Modes)**

*What must this project not become? Defining the negative space is a powerful way to set boundaries.*

**This Fails If It Becomes:** \[e.g., "Another productivity tool that optimizes for efficiency over depth," or "A community that becomes exclusive or dogmatic."\]

### **3\. Potential Pathways (Max 3\)**

*What are a few different forms this project could take? For each, list a trigger that would make you move toward or away from it.*

* **Path A:** \[e.g., "A body of research and writing."\]  
  * *Trigger Toward:* "If I find that the core problem is a lack of clarity, not a lack of tools."  
* **Path B:** \[e.g., "A physical place or community."\]  
  * *Trigger Toward:* "If I discover that co-location is the only way to foster the desired connections."  
* **Path C:** \[e.g., "A set of software tools."\]  
  * *Trigger Toward:* "If I can prove a specific, scalable intervention that a tool could provide."

### **4\. Guiding Principles of Operation**

*These are your personal rules of engagement for the project itself.*

* **Principle 1:** \[e.g., "Learn in public."\]  
* **Principle 2:** \[e.g., "Follow curiosity over obligation."\]

## **Part 3: The 'How to Learn' — From Thinking to Testing**

*This section translates the abstract into action. It is designed to be the most frequently updated part of the document, guiding your immediate next steps.*

### **1\. Riskiest Assumptions to Test Next (RATs)**

*From your hypotheses, what are the 1-3 assumptions that, if proven false, would completely invalidate your project? Phrase them as falsifiable questions.*

* **RAT 1:** \[e.g., "Can I find 10 people who are willing to pay $50 for a solution to this problem?"\]  
* **RAT 2:** \[e.g., "Will people actually use a tool that requires 30 minutes of deep focus per day?"\]

### **2\. Contradictions Ledger**

*List pairs of contradictory beliefs you hold. No resolution is required. Simply acknowledging them is the goal. Add a date.*

* **\[Date\]:** I believe this must be a solo project to maintain vision purity / I also believe this is too big to do alone.  
* **\[Date\]:** I believe this needs to be a non-profit / I also believe a for-profit model would scale faster.

### **3\. The Nascent Vision — A Working Synthesis**

*This is a temporary, living statement that captures the current state of your thinking.*

**My working hypothesis is that by exploring...**

\[The Core Problem/Question\]  
...guided by my connection to...  
\[The Personal Resonance\]  
...I might build toward a future where...  
\[The Idealized Future State\]  
...as long as it never becomes...  
\[The Anti-Vision\].

**The very next experiment I will run is to test:**

\[**Your \#1 Riskiest Assumption**\]

### **Change Log**

*A one-line diary of what shifted in your thinking and why. Timestamp every entry.*

* **\[YYYY-MM-DD\]:** Added Path C as a possibility after realizing \[reason\].  
* **\[YYYY-MM-DD\]:** Demoted a bedrock hypothesis to a mere hunch after \[conversation/experiment\].
