## Governance

### Values
- [U-014] I highly value being methodical with my process.
- [U-015] I highly value being intentional with my process.
- [U-030] The vision will be extremely grandiose to satisfy the craving in my mind.
- [U-034] Everything in the world must integrate together under unified systems and interfaces with all elements being cohesive with each other.
- [U-155] Tying small efforts into a larger effort makes them seem valuable and meaningful.

### Principles
- [U-033] The world will be built in increments.
- [U-036] The world will feature curated, creative content as an artistic expression.
- [U-047] Each iteration should add another layer of complexity and depth to the world.
- [U-118] The process should question the very nature of everything.
- [U-119] The process should tear everything down before taking incremental and methodical steps.
- [U-120] Each piece should build upon another to construct a bedrock foundation.
- [U-121] Each design or creative step should start with an exhaustive indexing of unknowns and possibilities.
- [U-141] The loop continues until elements are small enough to be implemented as a standalone package.
- [U-148] It should always be assumed that the AI needs to see the author's intent.
- [U-149] The author is a novice and may not have the standard terms to express their vision.

### Policies
- [U-051] Fine-tuning should be considered a major part of the process and lead to iteration.
- [U-052] Balancing should be considered a major part of the process.
- [U-053] The process of fine-tuning and balancing should mimic playing for fun and engagement.
- [U-065] The entire process should be documented from this point forward.

### Rules
- [U-103] The template could define outline structure and format rules.
- [U-104] The format rules could include how headings are done.
- [U-105] The format rules could include how lists are done.
- [U-123] Each design or creative step should be synthesized from the best elements as I decide among alternatives in a executive type role.
- [U-150] The author needs AI advice that understands their intent despite inexact phrasing.
- [U-151] If the author's vision is wrong, the AI should provide "best practice" advice as a suggestion.
- [U-152] The author would like to be consulted whenever the AI feels instructions are lacking.

## Facts

### Observations
- [U-001] The project is at its very beginning.
- [U-107] Past attempts at daily logs failed because a log was not needed every day.
- [U-108] The author was not closing out ideas from old writings.

### Definitions
- [U-161] A concept is being called a "historical ladder".
- [U-163] A concept is being called a "genre ladder".
- [U-179] Atomizing is an attempt to isolate every unique, valuable idea or piece of information.
- [U-162] Define the term "historical ladder".
- [U-164] Define the term "genre ladder".
- [U-178] Define the term "atomizing".

- [U-167] The opening presentation will be for in-narrative reasons.
- [U-168] The game's complexity will incrementally evolve in line with the progression of computer history.
- [U-169] The "genre ladder" is the same concept as the historical ladder, but applied to video game history.
- [U-172] The project wind-up should cover every element.
- [U-181] The process should not miss anything valuable.
- [U-200] I should research NLP more as it seems very relevant to the project.
- [U-194] A library of processing methods should be developed to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
- [U-072] A protocol is needed based on best practices for all LLM use cases over time.

### Requirements

## Action Items

### Questions / Assumptions / Hypotheses
- [U-100] A question is posed: Could a standard document template be implemented from day one?
- [U-114] The author assumes the conceptual layout of the file matters for AI processing.
- [U-126] The author questions if early logs and elements should be created differently since they are future assets.
- [U-127] A question is posed: What should be considered now to prevent rework?

### Problems / Issues / Bugs / Risks
- [U-128] Idea collection is an immediate concern due to a constant flow of ideas.
- [U-132] Currently, spontaneous ideas are being poorly documented and organized, or not collected at all.

### Backlog
- L - [U-070] A system is needed to organize and store these files.
- L - [U-096] The drafts from past efforts are not in a proper database, and these existing items need to be incorporated strategically.
- L - [U-116] A prompt system is needed to clean up writing for grammar and spelling only.
- L - [U-170] These content ideas should be implemented as soon as feasible after the "meta" phase.
- L - [U-171] Prior work on the computer and office setup should be reconsidered as part of Phase 0.

## Decisions
- [U-071] The plan is to use chat-based LLMs as a foundational tool and assistant in every step.

---

## Processes / Methods

### Process (SOP)
- [U-058] The author could brain-dump a lot of information in logs as part of process.
- [U-067] The logs will start as a documentation of the author's entire chain of thought.
- [U-109] A requirement is to "close-out" all old text from logs.
- [U-138] Documents should have parents and children. Information should be passed up to parent documents in higher-level summarization and passed down to child documents in more detail.
- [U-140] Parts will be broken down further in a recursive loop.
- [U-144] The breakdown continues down to "atomic" parts like implementation plans with completed assets.
- [U-159] Time spent on activities like Reddit should be justified by how it contributes to the project.
- [U-187] For now, let the labels emerge from groupings of atomized items.
- [U-190] The logs are the foundation of the project.
- [U-191] The logs must always serve as the starting point for the project record.
- [U-193] The project will often apply the same methods to processing problems, especially with LLMs.
- [U-206] The next log should be started for all follow-up once a log is atomized.
