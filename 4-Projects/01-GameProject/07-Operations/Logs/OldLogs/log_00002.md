## Initial Categorization System
What to do with all these to-dos?

So we have moved to the second log after creating a host of items to follow-up on some way below. I think we should work on how we organize these items first. This is actually represented in items 175 and 176 below as we have the "atomization" process drafted but not the organizing process. This is going to lead quickly to some kind of backlog program and policy I would think. We are going to need a whole system of categorization and a taxonomy for this. We can at least start with some ideas I already have for categorization, organizing and sorting. I see the major classes of the parsed information quickly emerging. See my conceptual rough draft below.

1)  **Rules** — Not tasks or stepwise procedures, but governing guidance that sits above work. Think of this as a future “rulebook” we can load as context to steer decisions. It should be hierarchical, with the top tier constraining the ones below. (Possible sub-groups: values, principles, standards, policies, rules.)

2)  **Facts** — Statements we can rely on and re-apply per subject. This is a context-engineering layer so the right fact shows up at the right time. (Possible sub-groups: worldbuilding/lore encyclopedia, observations, definitions.)

3)  **Ideas** — Possibilities that aren’t yet actionable; they need shaping, testing, and refinement before moving forward. (Casual sub-groups: requirements, constraints, resources—notes/links to be consumed and distilled into atoms later.)

4)  **Non-Valuable** — Items identified on first pass as not useful. These can be discarded during intake to keep the system lean.

5)  **Action Items** — Directly executable work with minimal additional shaping; should be timeline-sortable so near-term work isn’t crowded by distant items. (Possible sub-groups: questions/assumptions/hypotheses; problems/issues/bugs/risks; experiments/prototypes/spikes; backlog “to-dos”.)

6)  **Decisions**-Any clear statements of choosing. Think a best practice log to index and track decisions etc. Probably more useful when domain specific later maybe?

7)  **Processes/Procedures/Methods**-Things that are part of a larger process and should be added there or stored until that process is created. A complete index of processes will be required.

## Progress Updates and Roadmap

[UPDATE]

I have formalized my conceptual draft above and have a set of instructions for categorizing the atomized items now. I am going attempt to run it next followed by organizing. Pending the results, we will either tune the instructions, or prepare to start completing the items coming from the first log that are doable. I will check in later.

[UPDATE]

I have revised the sorter again to include 4 categories to sort into. I need to still change the sorter text at some point as a backlog item, but for not I want to make forward progress on the list we already have. I think I will start with a rough draft roadmap for this nascent phase even before a full foundational plan.

[UPDATE]

I completed the roadmap and sorted the backlog. Now I am working on standard template in Markdown with universal frontmatter elements. This is the very foundation of the knowledge system and I have already created documents, so I felt like that was important to take care of now. Then I will pivot to designing and implementing the file system for the project. Then I can bring in old files into the new structure. Then I think we take a pass at the tech and office set-up one more time, so we know everything is ready to really begin. THen we standardize the log system as that is already going. Then we create a true Phase 0 plan. Then we can truly start. That is the roadmap sketch to get us to the real roadmap.
