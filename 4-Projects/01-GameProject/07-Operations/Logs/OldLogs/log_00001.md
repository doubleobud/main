## Personal Motivations and Initial Direction
Here we are at the very start. So what is "this"?

First, let me define some things about me I know I particularly enjoy doing at this point in my life.
1. Building things both practical and artistic.
2. Seeing incremental effort build-up over time.
3. Being intellectually challenged with subject matter to the point where I feel completely engaged with the material.
4. Escapism especially in the form of gaming, but also other media, where I experience other worlds or strategic challenges.
5. Having a majority of my effort and attention directed to activities that contribute to a larger and longer term goal.
6. Exploring knowledge especially sampling what is consider the best of a given domain and then synthesizing those best pieces into my own curated, yet still evidence based, mental models or systems for my personal use.
7. I highly value being methodical and intentional with my process.

Where do these observations lead us?

I need to build something and I love gaming. I video game presents all the challenge and opportunity to build and create I could ever want. Knowledge exploration will contribute to designing and producing the game while all contributing to a larger, long-term goal. I do not just want to create a some isolated game though as that seems to not be the kind of long-term project I desire to work at this point in in my life. In fact, I want to work on a capstone type project at this point in my life where I am still young and have the opportunity to be retired with extraordinary amounts of free time. In the end though, whatever I do must be very enjoyable and offer that same element of escapism playing games has done in the past to be sustainable.

## Project Vision
What kind of scale and scope would be satisfying?

I am going to be extremely grandiose here as that is what satisfies the craving in my mind. I want to build a world of my own making. This would be a long-term project where the world is built in increments where everything integrates together under unified systems and interfaces while also featuring curated, creative content as an artistic expression. I envision an ever-growing fictional universe built on digital foundations that could evolve over the next 50 years. We could use as many elements as possible to flesh out the world including simulation aspects, gameplay, narratives, graphics, audio/video while not excluding any other possibility as long as all are cohesive together with each iteration adding another layer of complexity and depth to the world and universe. I also want to be able to experience the universe as a player where emergent interactions are novel even to the world's creator. Fine-tuning and balancing should be considered a major part of the process that is performed in ways that mimic playing for fun and engagement.

Any other vision level ideas to present now?

## Rough Draft Foundational Roadmap
What should I do next?

I do not know? I am just opened this file and just started typing. There is so much I could just brain-dump right now and I may just do that to kick things off. I will try to start with a foundational opening, and then I will just list whatever comes to mind with both to-do type items and more rule based items.

1.  **Documentation**-The entire process should be documented from this point forward which as already started with this first log. Whatever these logs develop into over time, we are starting them as essentially a documentation of my entire chain of thought through this project.
2.  **Storage**-This project will start out completely text based and stored in files. I need a system to organize and store these files.
3.  **Technology**-I plan to use chat-based LLMs as a foundational tool and assistant in every step of the process. I need a protocol based on best practices across all use cases over time.
4.  **Meta**-I do not want to just jump into this process. In fact, I have spent at least two years thinking and researching various things about this endeavor as I waited for the technology to catch up. Rather than jumping right into the project, I would prefer an exhaustive and comprehensive meta-level type process where we start from first principles at every level and only creep into details as many levels down into the process.
5.  **Project Management**-I immediately need a "to-do" capturing system and "rule" capturing system which I have drafts of that need tuned. This list is the foundation of the to-do backlog. There are plenty of rules to extract even from this first log. This rest of project management can flow from the "meta" foundations in Step 4.
6.  **Life Management**-My current way of life is sustainable, but I could use to add some structure to it to maximize my enjoyment of both my personal and this newly formed "professional" life. I view this overall project and effort as a hobby and passion project, but the time commitment will meet and exceed professional levels if the levels of enjoyment I expect to have doing this are found.
7.  **Existing Documentation**-There is quite a bit of existing documentation that is not well organized but contains months of valuable effort and research. I need to strategically incorporate these items as some will apply to the earliest "meta" phases and other to more specifics well into the project. I also have fairly well-organized and developed rough drafts of concepts plans all not in a proper database.
8.  **Next Step**-I should do something with this log as the next, micro, step. What is even that? That is where we start once this is done.

## Brain-Dump Context
A. Is there some standard document template I could implement from day one that would apply no matter what future doc was created even years from now? This would be the frontmatter foundation and maybe an outline structure/format rules...how headings are done, lists etc. Universal things for text docs etc. Not sure on anything of this and need to explore.

B. I tried doing logs by the day before but I didn't need one every day as I couldn't get everything I dumped and was not closing out ideas from old writings. It's like I have to "close-out" all old text and either "finish" it or push it to a more detailed document where all the important information is carried forward and thus the old document text section is still "closed".

C. I need to build this file system like a knowledge database that let's a chat based AI "read" it as well as possible. I will probably start by just loading files into the context window so the structure of the file and it conceptual layout all matter I assume? Very important.

D. I need a prompt system to clean up my writing without changing anything other than grammar and spelling.

E. I really want the "wind-up" of this process to really be representative of a 50 year effort. We should question the very nature of everything, tearing everything done before taking even the more incremental and methodical step where each piece builds upon on another to construct the most bedrock foundation before moving to the next integrated piece. Each step of the way start with an exhaustive and comprehensive indexing of unknowns and possibilities before synthesizing a process made from the best elements that will let the result emerge.

F. I hesitate to even add this now, but I plan on everything to be part of the experience including these logs and everything created along the way. I will be immersively presented which I have a plan for. I only bring that up now as perhaps this is something to consider in how these early logs and other elements are created considering the are future assets themselves etc. What should I be thinking about now to prevent rework.

G. Idea collection is an immediate concern as I am constantly generated ideas. I want a formal idea generation process and a educational process and a research process that will all lead to ideas; but at this point I just have this flow of spontaneous ideas that are being poorly documented and organized at best and not collected at worst. I know categorization here is very tough as an extensive taxonomy is going to be required that is hard to have it be emergent.

H. I want this project to be designed "on paper" mainly in text as a first step. This should be represented in the file structure and document system where documents have parents and children where information is passed down in more detail and up and higher level of summarization. Someone can drill down and see a concepts be broken down into it's constitute parts that represent all the pieces of it's constituent whole. The broken down parts are broken down further in a recursive loop until elements are so small that can be implemented as a standalone "package" that could be added to the experience. At the very top is the project as a whole, next level is it's major divisions, then that breakdown continues until we reach "atomic" parts like implementation plans will completed assets ready etc. This creates an enormous and complex taxonomy/ontology that provide not only a structure for files and the database but all a conceptual flow of topics. The project could essentially be defined by what amounts to a taxonomy of keywords in hierarchy that could go tens of levels deep.

I. I need to emphasize that it should always be assumed I need AI to see my intent of what I am writing. I have a vision but since I am a novice in these topics, I often do not have the terms and phrasing to be able to say my vision in the most recognizable way that would be consider standard language for that topic if I only knew it. This is even hard to say and it kind of meta in a sense. Like I know construction fairly well, so I know I can use LVL beams in a floor structure to increase span while limited floor thickness/cost/wall support. Now, maybe if I did not know this topic at all, all I would be able to say is something like "I would like this room to be bigger" not knowing that what I really should say is "Let's switch to LVLs for the floor in the room above so we can span this whole room and remove this small bearing wall that partitions the room." Hopefully that example helps in what I need from AI-advice that does this always while achieving my vision. Lastly, sometimes my vision will be just plain wrong and I will need "best practice" advice, but it should also be as a suggestion. I would like to be consulted generally whenever you feel instructions are lacking, not just for control, but so my context engineering can improve by adding/clarifying the instructions.

J. I need my life to start feeding into the project more as soon as feasible. This is again about tying small efforts into a larger effort to make them seem valuable. This makes things so much more meaningful and special to me with this extra element. I tried forcing this before by documenting and rating my life in various ways to almost "preserve" all these small efforts to make them feel part of a larger system. Little things would be scored and contribute to an aggregate score for the week so everything felt meaningful in a way. I would like video game playing to start doing this right away, but everything can lead to ideas for the project in some way. If I am fucking around on Reddit, I should identify how it is going to contribute in some way before I burn time on it for example.

K. I have a plan for the start of the game is that is very simple and will allow us to get going right away. I am calling the concept a "historical ladder" and a "genre ladder". The historical ladder is a concept that the game will open with a presentation and function of the very earliest computers for in-narrative reasons. Over time, the game's complexity with incrementally evolve in-line with the progression of computers over their entire history so far. The genre ladder is the same concept applied to video game history. This is all way ahead of where it should be, but I bring this up as content is right around the corner and we should get up as soon as feasible given a "meta" and "phase 0" opener we are planning.

L. I have done some work already with my basic computer and office set-up but all of that should be on the table as part of Phase 0. I am serious when I say this wind-up should cover every element.

## Log Processing and Atomization

[UPDATE]

When you see the [UPDATE] line in these logs, that represents a break in time from last entry where I completed some action which will be described in the log or a break was taken etc.

Reading back through the log, I decided to start exactly where I indicated in this passage: "8. Next Step-I should do something with this log as the next, micro, step. What is even that? That is where we start once this is done." After thinking about it some, I think I should work on designing and implementing some process for taking these logs and breaking them down and organizing them. I am conceptualizing this process as "atomizing" where we try to isolate every unique idea, concept, to-do, rule, piece of knowledge or whatever else we deem valuable. That is the first question, what is valuable to extract? We do not want to miss anything as we try to produce a list of individual items all coherent on their own. This could involve breaking sentences into many separate self-contained lines each with only one idea. I want to feel like after the atomization is complete, I could eventually "cross-off" every word from every sentence of the log as I would know everything would be accounted for and addressed if I complete every atomized element-a complete accounting.

Once we have this list, I think some process of organizing and categorizing needs to take place. Designing this upfront could be tricky. I eventually want a full prepared system for this function, but for now we should probably this the labels emerge from groupings and come back to the formal classification system. I do want to fully build out the parsing aspect now though so nothing is missed. These logs are the foundation of the project and always serve as the starting point for the record of the entire project.

I think it is best to have the AI suggest some courses of action next. On that note, I know as we go along that we are often going to be applying the same methods to processing problems and information especially with the LLMs. It would be nice to develop a library of these things to select from rather than re-inventing the wheel each time. This includes standard prompts but its more than that and hard to say clearly. It's like some projects, problems, or processes would be best done by executing some kind of approach suited for that area. It could be a problem solving method or a goal development model or a standard method of applying logic and reason to this class of ideas. Again I don't know how to say it, but I do know the concepts and principles behind what I am trying to say are real and used all the time.

[UPDATE]

I went the route of developing instructions to "atomize" the text. I briefly looked at concepts of breaking down text like parsing, sentence diagramming, and information extraction. The overarching concept was 'natural language processing (NLP)" concepts. I should more into this as it seems very relevant to many aspects of this project. That brings to mind that we also need to atomize these [UPDATE]s as there will be more things to index in them along with some items being completed etc. This might be tricky to design.

After just a short time I have added the instructions for dealing with these [UPDATE] sections. Now I can atomize this log to this point. I think it would be wise to now close this log and start the second one for all the follow-up from here. Of course, the second log with still be adding new ideas as they occur in the writing process, but I will mainly focus on doing the open items or creating rules and policies etc.

That being said, this is the end of the first log.

169. [U-169] The "genre ladder" is the same concept as the historical ladder, but applied to video game history.
170. [U-170] These content ideas should be implemented as soon as feasible after the "meta" phase.
171. [U-171] Prior work on the computer and office setup should be reconsidered as part of Phase 0.
172. [U-172] The project wind-up should cover every element.
173. [U-173] An [UPDATE] line in logs represents a break in time.
174. [U-174] The decision was made to start by processing the current log.
175. [U-175] A process should be designed for taking logs, breaking them down, and organizing them.
176. [U-176] A process should be implemented for taking logs, breaking them down, and organizing them.
177. [U-177] The process of breaking down logs is conceptualized as "atomizing".
178. [U-178] Define the term "atomizing".
179. [U-179] Atomizing is an attempt to isolate every unique, valuable idea or piece of information.
180. [U-180] A question is posed: what is valuable to extract from the logs?
181. [U-181] The process should not miss anything valuable.
182. [U-182] The goal is to produce a list of individual items that are coherent on their own.
183. [U-183] Atomization could involve breaking sentences into separate self-contained lines with only one idea.
184. [U-184] The goal is a feeling of complete accounting, where every word from the log is addressed.
185. [U-185] After atomization, a process of organizing and categorizing needs to take place.
186. [U-186] Designing the organization system upfront could be tricky.
187. [U-187] For now, let the labels emerge from groupings of atomized items.
188. [U-188] A formal classification system can be developed later.
189. [U-189] The parsing aspect of atomization should be fully built out now so nothing is missed.
190. [U-190] The logs are the foundation of the project.
191. [U-191] The logs must always serve as the starting point for the project record.
192. [U-192] The AI should suggest some courses of action next.
193. [U-193] The project will often apply the same methods to processing problems, especially with LLMs.
194. [U-194] A library of processing methods should be developed to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
195. [U-195] The library should include standard prompts.
196. [U-196] The library should include more than just prompts, like problem-solving methods or goal development models.
197. [U-197] Instructions for "atomizing" the text were developed.
198. [U-198] The author briefly researched concepts like parsing, sentence diagramming, and information extraction.
199. [U-199] The overarching concept found was natural language processing (NLP).
200. [U-200] I should research NLP more as it seems very relevant to the project.
201. [U-201] The atomization process also needs to be applied to [UPDATE] sections.
202. [U-202] Designing the atomization of [UPDATE] sections might be tricky.
203. [U-203] Instructions for dealing with [UPDATE] sections have been added.
204. [U-204] The current log can now be atomized up to this point.
205. [U-205] This log should be closed.
206. [U-206] A second log should be started for all follow-up.
207. [U-207] The second log will still have new ideas added during the writing process.
208. [U-208] The main focus of the second log will be acting on open items.
209. [U-209] The main focus of the second log will be creating rules and policies.
210. [U-210] This is the end of the first log.
