I could gamify the process for myself that the reader/player could also participate in. Today's quest is... Perhaps they could also try to guess which direction I took among alternatives perhaps etc.

Challenges in the form of quizzes and tests etc.

How do I resolve whether I am "in-character" or not, is there going to be in and out of character elements with some being very secret like one's that break the narrative wall etc.

I could frame the early "log" game as prospective players seeing the game come online, that is hard to resolve with historical ladder concept. That is getting harder to pull off anyway.

The knowledge system could be used with RPG right from the get go. Back to the website concept.

Some parts are redacted so its like a treasure hunt. Maybe you fill in "fact" boards. Some parts "ruin" the story so they are truly meta and at the very end to unlock. The 3rd wall breaking parts.

Codex and knowledge system completion game-ready your brain etc.
