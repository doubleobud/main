Here is the pitch for the opening the game

"I" will play a computer enthusiast who begins a lifelong project in the year 1970 as a young computer prodigy. They have a DEC PDP-10 with a DEC VT05 (1970). They want to build a hybrid simulation/video game project, and now is the perfect time to start as "screens" are not available over the old paper teletype systems.

Even at this very young age, I a aware of video game history and my dad is leader in the industry who has connections and attends conferences. 

We can only design and create the experience in the most crude way due to the technology and my age. The simulation and game will be ever-evolving small increments. Sometimes those increments will be based on current tech while we build out new features under that era, but other times we will gain in increase in capability from a technological improvement.

These improvements are to mirror computer and video game development in great detail and the track the timeline exactly. I want to have a Forrest Gump type story where I start inventing most of the tech myself as part of the story... at least with turned-based, strategy, and RPG type things or based computer improvements that expand the project etc.

The experience gets more and more complex over time as I need new innovations as they come on-line to end up with a modern simulation strategy sandbox RPG experiences with no limitation on what could be possible within that framework in a persistent lifelong project.

After the intro, I want to player to find themselves in a mysterious bunker-starting in one room alone without much context. The extent of the bunker is slowly revealed.

The player finds out they are in the bunker with me. We are creating the simulation "in-narrative" together in this bunker. Think of "me" and the player as both becoming agents in a "meta" level of game where we are creating and interacting with the simulation we built on the meta level. This allows Assassins Creed type interaction where you can jump into the sim etc. However our game just opens well outside as the sim isn't even built yet.

I have not worked out the order yet but the bunker will have things to do as we work on getting the sim going. These include:

0. Opening text concept: "The year I am writing this is 1970, but you may be interacting with this program much later. Here is what computers are currently capable of to support my vision: (list here). With that being said, we can only do so much for now. However, I envision an endless series of incremental upgrades bolted onto a future proof framework that gives the experiences more depth, complexity, and interactability with each development."

1. Reading stories in like a digital novel presentation. They will access the stories from in the bunker. The stories will be about the world the simulation will be based on (mysteriously presented as there is a twist here later).

2. Exploring the bunker and working on expanding it.

3. Accessing an arcade featuring simple prototype type projects like my version of Tennis for Two and more early historical "reflex" games that will never be part of the scope of the core game.

4. Talking to me and having a dialogue tree to explore to learn about me etc.

5. Early testing to shape their character in all kinds of ways where each segment introduces some new aspect about their character.

6. Developer Logs-This is how they read about, interact with, and unlock new features with the sim etc. These are written by my character in-universe

7. Hacking-They can start doing things "outside" my control fairly early.

8. Getting introduced to the knowledge and codex system which is extensive along with the roguelike unlock features for the "meta" level...start character building with learning etc.

I will have played some of the landmark titles leading up to 1970 and have their mechanics. How much can I refer to the game directly without legal problems?

In my Forrest Gump plot, I should move from situation to situation with perfect timing to be in the right place/right time situation each time there is some innovation and I always get involved.

I could even emulate earlier eras on my 1970 rig to show learning since I am so young. So like make my own Sumerian game with the 1970 tech I have.

I need to consider memory limitations and other things and how that affects mechanics.

I have the arsenal of ASCII symbols for pseudo UI divisions and maps. Need to check this. You can even do some limited data visualization with ASCII. 

I would still like to justify a digital novel, very primitive start look. Perhaps 1970 is that but there is way more function than I want. Could Dad be at a university with experimental computers perhaps? That could allow a start before 1970 and all the ASCII visual depictions etc. Even illustrations with ASCII are possible so that again pushes the scope.

The 24 hour persistent clock should start here in this phase and early.

The beginnings of characterization are here.

I might make some of logs very special and secret, at least some of them, as they would one the few things not "in-narrative" or truly out of the world even at the meta level.

We could do my lineage and tell stories of early computing too just to bring the reader in etc. This could be one variant of stories set in the meta universe lore.

Forrest Gump of tech where I am in the early days and keep checking in as we advance etc. The player experiences the full evolution of everything where me or my dad keeps inventing stuff etc.

The main way to advance the complexity of the simulation should be through my logs. You can play the game as-is without logs but you need new ones released to experience new add-ons. You can unlock the logs in game though.

You can continue to add numbers to your serial as we advance through the eras.
