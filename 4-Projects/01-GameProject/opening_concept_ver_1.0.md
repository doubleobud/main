> _Summary_: A meta-narrative game where the player joins a computer prodigy in a mysterious bunker to co-create a simulation/RPG. The project begins in 1970 and evolves over decades, mirroring the history of computer technology and game design in a "Forrest Gump" style narrative where the protagonist invents key technologies.

## High-Concept Pitch
The player joins a computer enthusiast who begins a lifelong project in 1970 as a young computer prodigy. The story follows a "Forrest Gump" narrative, where the protagonist is always in the right place at the right time to be involved with, or personally invent, major innovations in turn-based, strategy, and RPG genres, as well as core computer technology. The game starts with crude technology (a DEC PDP-10 with a DEC VT05) and incrementally evolves. Each technological advancement in history unlocks new capabilities and adds complexity, growing the experience from a primitive ASCII interface into a modern, limitless simulation strategy sandbox RPG within a persistent lifelong project.

## Narrative Premise & Setting
After an initial introduction, the player finds themselves in a single room within a mysterious, slowly revealed bunker. They discover they are not alone; the game's narrator and creator ("I") is also in the bunker. The core narrative premise is that the player and the narrator are partners, creating the simulation "in-narrative" together. This creates a meta-level to the game where both parties are agents who can interact with the simulation they are building, similar to the Animus in *Assassin's Creed*, allowing for direct interaction with the simulated world.

## Core Gameplay Loops (Bunker Phase)
While the simulation is in its early stages of development, the bunker itself serves as the primary gameplay area, offering various activities:
- **Reading Stories:** The player can access a digital novel to read stories about the world the simulation will be based on. This lore is presented mysteriously to hint at a later twist.
- **Bunker Exploration & Expansion:** The player can explore the bunker and work on expanding its footprint over time.
- **Arcade Prototypes:** An in-bunker arcade will feature simple, reflex-based prototype projects (e.g., a "Tennis for Two" equivalent) that represent early historical games but are outside the scope of the core simulation.
- **Dialogue with the Narrator:** The player can engage in dialogue trees with the narrator ("I") to learn about their history, motivations, and the project's background.
- **Character Testing:** The player undergoes early testing scenarios that introduce new aspects of their character and begin to shape their meta-level character.
- **Hacking:** The player can begin to perform actions "outside" the narrator's control fairly early on, introducing a hacking mechanic.

---

## Progression and Advancement
The primary method for advancing the simulation's complexity and adding new features is through **Developer Logs**. These are in-universe documents written by the narrator.
- **Unlocking Features:** Players can play the simulation as-is at any point, but to experience new add-ons, features, and technological eras, they must find and unlock new Developer Logs.
- **In-Game Unlocks:** Logs are unlocked through in-game actions and exploration, serving as the main progression mechanic.
- **Secret Logs:** Some logs will be very special and secret, existing outside the primary narrative (truly "meta") and revealing deeper truths.

## Technical & Historical Faithfulness
The project is designed to mirror the detailed history of computer and video game development.
- **Starting Point:** The game begins in 1970 with a DEC PDP-10 and a DEC VT05 terminal, establishing a baseline for capability.
- **Hardware Limitations:** Mechanics will be constrained by the technology of the era, including memory limitations that directly affect gameplay.
- **Visuals:** The initial experience will rely entirely on ASCII characters for pseudo-UI, maps, and even limited data visualizations and illustrations.
- **Emulation:** To demonstrate the learning process of the young prodigy, the player may be tasked with emulating even earlier eras (e.g., creating a "Sumerian game" clone) using the available 1970 technology. (Dad can have a home course as he is cutting edge.)

## Character, Lore, and Knowledge Systems
The game will feature extensive systems for character development and world-building.
- **Characterization:** The beginnings of the player's character are established through interactive testing segments after creating the very basic of "agents" first.
- **Codex and Knowledge:** A comprehensive knowledge and codex system will be introduced early. This system will integrate with roguelike unlock features for the "meta" level of gameplay. The meta-level is where the simulation is interacted with from a "nuts and bolts" perspective which will fit well with the unlock screens from roguelike among other "front-end" elements. 
- **Lore Delivery:** Lore will be delivered through multiple avenues, including readable stories in the digital novel format. One variant of these stories will cover the narrator's lineage and the early history of computing, grounding the player in the meta-universe.

## Opening Player Experience
The game will begin with a text-based introduction to set the stage and manage expectations based on the 1970 starting point. The proposed opening text is:

*"The year I am writing this is 1970, but you may be interacting with this program much later. Here is what computers are currently capable of to support my vision: (list here). With that being said, we can only do so much for now. However, I envision an endless series of incremental upgrades bolted onto a future proof framework that gives the experiences more depth, complexity, and interactability with each development."*

## Key Design Considerations
Several key questions and concepts need to be addressed during development:
- **Legal:** How closely can the game refer to landmark historical titles and their mechanics without creating legal problems?
- **Timeline Justification:** To achieve a more primitive, pre-ASCII visual style, the story could be adjusted to start before 1970, with the narrator's father working at a university with experimental computers.
- **Persistent Clock:** A 24-hour persistent clock should be implemented very early in the game's first phase.
- **Serial Number:** The player character's serial number could be expanded with additional numbers as the game advances through different technological eras.


RAW NOTES TO ADD:

All documentation for making the game will be in the game and be revealed as mastery is gained.
