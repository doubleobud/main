# Instructions: Extracting and Formatting Titles for Excel

Follow these steps to convert a list of titles (such as from a screenshot) into a clean, copy-paste-ready list for Excel.

---

## Step 1: Provide the Screenshot
- Upload or paste the screenshot that contains the list of titles.

---

## Step 2: Request the Titles
- Ask for the titles to be **listed one per line**, specifically formatted for copy–pasting into Excel.
- Example request:
  > "Please extract the titles from this screenshot. List them one per line so I can paste them into an Excel column."

---

## Step 3: Copy the Output
- The output should look like this:

```

Title One
Title Two
Title Three

```

- Each title will be on its own line.

---

## Step 4: Paste into Excel
- Copy the formatted list from the response.
- Go to Excel, click the first cell where you want the list to begin.
- Paste (Ctrl+V or Command+V).
- Each title will appear in its own row, correctly aligned in a single column.

---

## Notes
- This format works because Excel automatically treats line breaks (`Enter`) as separate rows when pasting into a column.
- Double-check the list for accuracy after pasting.

Do you want me to also add a **"Quick Example"** section with the exact song titles from your screenshot as a template in this file?
