# **Time Block System**

## **0\. Guiding Principles**

This protocol is a practical implementation of the principles outlined in the Personal Charter. It is designed to be a resilient and adaptive framework for managing time, energy, and attention. It is built upon the core values of **Intentionality**, **Well-Being**, and **Excellence**, and operates under the directives of **Human Primacy**, **Emergent Design**, and **Constraint-First Framing**.

## **1\. The Foundational Rhythm**

The system operates on a consistent two-hour cycle, which is the core tempo of the day.

* **90-Minute Focus Block:** A dedicated period for focused work, maintenance, or recovery.  
* **30-Minute Transition Protocol:** A structured break designed to close out the previous block, capture data, recharge, and plan the next block.

The day begins with a **30-Minute Wake-Up Routine** and concludes with a **30-Minute Sleep Routine**.

## **2\. The Block Architecture**

Flexibility is achieved by being intentional about the *content* of each 90-minute block. This is done by constructing each block from pre-defined "Task Modules." The specific *types* of blocks (e.g., "Deep Work," "Maintenance") will emerge over time through your planning and review process.

### **Task Modules (The Building Blocks)**

* **Full Block \[90m\]:** A single, atomic task requiring deep, unbroken concentration.  
* **Double Unit \[60m\]:** A substantial task requiring significant focus.  
* **Single Unit \[30m\]:** A small, discrete task for administrative work, chores, or focused recovery.

## **3\. Sample Daily Rhythm**

This template illustrates how the system flows throughout a typical day, accounting for 7.5 hours of sleep. The content of each Focus Block is determined in the preceding Transition Protocol by selecting from your "Block Menu."

* **6:30 AM \- 7:00 AM:** Wake-Up Routine (30m)  
* **7:00 AM \- 8:30 AM:** Focus Block 1 (90m)  
* **8:30 AM \- 9:00 AM:** Transition Protocol 1 (30m)  
* **9:00 AM \- 10:30 AM:** Focus Block 2 (90m)  
* **10:30 AM \- 11:00 AM:** Transition Protocol 2 (30m)  
* **11:00 AM \- 12:30 PM:** Focus Block 3 (90m)  
* **12:30 PM \- 1:00 PM:** Transition Protocol 3 (30m)  
* **1:00 PM \- 2:30 PM:** Focus Block 4 (90m)  
* **2:30 PM \- 3:00 PM:** Transition Protocol 4 (30m)  
* **3:00 PM \- 4:30 PM:** Focus Block 5 (90m)  
* **4:30 PM \- 5:00 PM:** Transition Protocol 5 (30m)  
* **5:00 PM \- 6:30 PM:** Focus Block 6 (90m)  
* **6:30 PM \- 7:00 PM:** Transition Protocol 6 (30m)  
* **7:00 PM \- 8:30 PM:** Focus Block 7 (90m)  
* **8:30 PM \- 9:00 PM:** Transition Protocol 7 (30m)  
* **9:00 PM \- 10:30 PM:** Focus Block 8 (90m)  
* **10:30 PM \- 11:00 PM:** Sleep Routine (30m)

## **4\. The 30-Minute Transition Protocol**

This protocol is the engine of the system. It is a structured sequence that concludes each two-hour cycle and prepares for the next. The phases are ordered to consolidate "desk time" first, freeing you up for the remainder of the break.

#### **Phase 1: System Interface (Approx. 15 Minutes)**

*This is your dedicated time for interacting with the system at your desk.*

1. **Review & Record (Past):** Immediately capture data from the preceding 90-minute block.  
   * **Quantitative Data:** Focus Score (1-5), Energy Score (1-5), Satisfaction Score (1-5), Block Completion (%).  
   * **Qualitative Data:** One-Sentence Summary, Point of Friction, Point of Flow, System Note/Idea.  
2. **Plan & Commit (Future):** Intentionally select and commit to the next 90-minute block.  
   * **Assess Constraints:** Check your current energy, context, and priorities.  
   * **Consult the Block Menu:** Review your available, pre-approved options.  
   * **Build Your Block:** Select the Task Module(s) that will fill the 90-minute container (\[90m\], \[60m\]+\[30m\], or \[30m\]x3).  
   * **Commit:** Lock the selected block(s) into your calendar or timer.

#### **Phase 2: Physical Reset (Approx. 15 Minutes)**

*Once planning is complete, get up and away from your desk for a full physical and environmental reset.*

* **Recharge & Move:** Offset physical inactivity and reset mentally.  
  * **Movement Menu:** Choose from Low, Medium, or High-Intensity options (e.g., stretching, kettlebell swings, burpees).  
* **Reset & Refuel:** Reset your environment and your body.  
  * **Environmental Reset:** Tidy desk, close unused tabs, put away one item, load/unload dishwasher.  
  * **Personal Refuel:** Drink a full glass of water (non-negotiable), consume a pre-planned snack, attend to minor hygiene.

At the end of the 30 minutes, you are reviewed, planned, recharged, and ready to engage with your next block with absolute clarity.
