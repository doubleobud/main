Below is a fully built system for running **primary tasks (action/work)** and **secondary media (background intake)** without tripping over your limited attention. It’s exhaustive but structured so you can actually use it.

---

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Attention Is Finite:** Primary tasks get priority; secondary media must flex to leftover bandwidth.
2. **Match Load to Load:** High-load tasks pair with low-load media (or silence). Low-load tasks can pair with richer media.
3. **Interruptibility Rule:** If the primary task can’t afford interruption, the secondary channel must be nearly interruption-free.
4. **Escalation Path:** Secondary media can promote itself to primary status only by explicit choice (e.g., a “prestige film” night).
5. **Contextualization:** Time of day, energy state, and environment matter; set default pairings that match your rhythm.
6. **Granular Controls:** Use attention “gates” (timers, physical setup, device settings) to protect focus and seamlessly switch modes.

## 2. The Attention Load Scales

### Primary Task Cognitive Load (PTCL) – Score 1–5

* **5**: Deep reading, writing, complex strategy, coding new features, analytical thinking
* **4**: Detailed editing, documentation, medium-complex design, novel problem-solving
* **3**: Routine knowledge work, email triage, light design tweaks, familiar coding patterns
* **2**: Chores, repetitive admin tasks, data entry, organizing files
* **1**: Physical tasks on autopilot, commuting on familiar routes, playing a well-known game

### Secondary Media Cognitive Demand (SMCD) – Score 1–5

* **5**: Prestige film/TV, complex documentaries, new high-quality books/podcasts you care about deeply
* **4**: Thoughtful YouTube essays, in-depth interviews, unfamiliar narrative podcasts
* **3**: Light documentaries, shows you’ve partially seen, casual streamers, mid-depth podcasts
* **2**: Familiar TV/movies, casual YouTube, background music with lyrics you know
* **1**: Instrumental music, white noise, ambient soundscapes, playlists for focus

**Rule of Thumb:** PTCL + SMCD ≤ 6 for sustainable dual engagement. If PTCL≥4, keep SMCD≤2 or none.

## 3. Matrix: Primary Task vs. Media Pairing

| Primary Task Type/Example                         | PTCL | Allowed Secondary Media (Examples)                                    | SMCD Cap |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Deep reading, coding new features, writing essays | 5    | Silence, instrumental/ambient music only                              | 1        |
| Intensive editing, complex planning               | 4    | Lo-fi beats, familiar lyric music at low volume                       | 1–2      |
| Routine knowledge work, email triage              | 3    | Light docu/YouTube essay you can glance at, casual podcasts           | 2–3      |
| Chores (dishes, laundry), low-mental admin        | 2    | Podcasts (variety), long-form interviews, new TV you don’t care about | 3–4      |
| Autopilot tasks / known games                     | 1    | Secondary screen: TV/docs you’ve seen before; exploratory YouTube     | 4–5      |
| “Prestige” media (becomes primary)                | N/A  | No secondary allowed (lock-in mode)                                   | N/A      |
| Books (serious reading/listening) as primary      | 5    | None                                                                  | 0–1      |

---

## 4. Decision Tree (Quick Use)

1. **Identify primary task & its load (1–5).**
2. **Is it PTCL ≥4?**

   * Yes: Secondary media = 0–1 SMCD. If reading, use silence or instrumental.
   * No: Continue.
3. **Can the primary task tolerate glance/interruptions?**

   * No: Keep media audio only (podcast/music) or none.
   * Yes: Visual media okay if it fits SMCD cap.
4. **Is media new and precious (“prestige”)?**

   * Yes: Promote it to primary; schedule a dedicated session.
   * No: Use as background as per cap.
5. **Check total (PTCL + SMCD ≤6).** If >6, downgrade media.

## 5. Daily Rhythm Template

| Time Block      | Energy/Context (Example)                                 | Primary Tasks                              | Secondary Media Default              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Morning (7–10)  | High cognitive freshness, reading-heavy digital projects | Writing, reading, coding new things        | Instrumental/ambient                 |
| Midday (10–1)   | Slightly reduced focus                                   | Routine work, emails, design tweaks        | Light podcasts or docu-YouTube       |
| Afternoon (1–4) | Energy dip                                               | Chores, admin, physical tasks              | Podcasts/interviews/new TV           |
| Late Afternoon  | Second wind possible                                     | Creative brainstorming, planning           | Low-volume playlists, familiar shows |
| Evening         | Relax, leisure                                           | Gaming familiar titles or chores           | TV/docs/movies you've seen           |
| Night           | Wind-down, reflection, consolidation                     | Journaling, reading for pleasure (primary) | Silence or very low ambient          |

## 6. Implementation Workflow

### A. Pre-Build Your “Media Menus”

Create **queues** tagged by SMCD level and format:

* **Music (SMCD 1–2)**: Focus playlists, ambient tracks.
* **Podcasts/Audio (SMCD 2–4)**: Tag by topic and cognitive demand.
* **YouTube/Video Essays (SMCD 2–4)**: Tag those okay to half-watch.
* **Familiar TV/Movies (SMCD 2–3)**: Shows you’ve already seen.
* **Prestige Queue (SMCD 5)**: Must-watch items, kept separate, scheduled solo.
* **Docs for Visual Glance (SMCD 3–4)**: Keep a saved watchlist.

### B. Pre-Build “Task Menus”

Tag primary tasks by PTCL:

* PTCL 5: Original writing, deep reading, novel code
* PTCL 4: Complex editing, design thinking, strategic planning
* PTCL 3: Emails, routine code, content formatting
* PTCL 2: Admin, chores, tidying files
* PTCL 1: Folding laundry, autopilot gaming, commuting

### C. Matching Engine

1. Choose primary task first.
2. Look up PTCL tag and pick a compatible SMCD queue.
3. Start session with default pairing.
4. Adjust mid-session if needed (e.g., if you find yourself pausing too often, downgrade media).

### D. Session Card Template

* **Primary Task**: (Name & PTCL)
* **Secondary Media Choice**: (Playlist/Podcast/YouTube list & SMCD)
* **Total Load**: PTCL + SMCD = (≤6?)
* **Session Length & Break Plan**: (e.g., 50 min focus, 10 min break)
* **Escalation Rule**: If I pause more than twice in 10 minutes → mute/kill secondary media.

## 7. Rules & Safeguards

1. **No Passive Drift:** If secondary media steals focus often, reclassify it upwards and protect your primary.
2. **Dynamic Downgrading:** Mid-task, if you feel distracted, step down SMCD (pause video → switch to music).
3. **Scheduled Prestige:** Allocate dedicated slots for high-value media with no secondary tasks.
4. **Energy-Based Swaps:** If energy plummets, temporarily switch to low-PTCL tasks but keep secondary moderate.
5. **Finite Queues:** Don’t doom-scroll; pre-curate sets.
6. **Micro-Checkpoints:** Every 25–50 minutes, ask: “Is the pairing still working?” Adjust as needed.

## 8. Infrastructure & Tools

* **Task/Media Tagging:**

  * Tools: Notion, Airtable, Todoist (PTCL tags), Plex/YouTube playlists (SMCD tags).
* **Attention Gates:**

  * Timers (Pomodoro), app blockers for prestige media during work blocks.
* **Physical Setup:**

  * Separate screens/monitors or put video on a distant screen for “glance” mode.
  * Headphones that can switch between noise-canceling and transparency quickly.
* **Automation:**

  * Keyboard macros to mute/pause media instantly.
  * Scheduled “prestige” sessions in calendar to avoid creeping into work time.

---

## 9. Queue & Tag Examples

**Podcast Queue**

* SMCD 4: Deep interview shows (Lex Fridman, Hardcore History)
* SMCD 3: Topic-based narrative pods (Radiolab, Freakonomics)
* SMCD 2: Light banter shows, comedic pods

**YouTube Queue**

* SMCD 4: Long video essays (new, complex topics)
* SMCD 3: Mid-depth explainers, tech channels you follow
* SMCD 2: Creators you watch casually, reaction compilations
* SMCD 1: Ambient channels (lo-fi streams, fireplace, nature cams)

**TV/Movie Queue**

* SMCD 5: Prestige premieres (new drama you care about)
* SMCD 3–4: New but low-investment shows
* SMCD 2: Comfort rewatches

**Music Queue**

* SMCD 1: Instrumental, binaural beats, ambient
* SMCD 2: Familiar lyric playlists (low volume)

---

## 10. Edge Cases & Special Environments

* **Driving:** Treat as PTCL 2–3 (because safety) ⇒ podcasts okay, but prestige media not.
* **Gym:** If workout is routine, PTCL 1–2 ⇒ any audio fine. If learning complicated form, lower SMCD.
* **Social Spaces:** Expect interruptions—keep SMCD low or purely ambiance.
* **Gaming:**

  * New game/story mode = PTCL 4–5 ⇒ silence or chill music.
  * Known game/grind = PTCL 1 ⇒ docs/TV okay.

## 11. Review & Optimization Loop

Every week (e.g., Sunday night):

1. **Log Review:** Where did focus leak? Which pairings worked best?
2. **Adjust Tags:** Bump certain media up or down in SMCD based on experience.
3. **Reshuffle Queues:** Refill and prune your “background” lists.
4. **Plan Prestige:** Slot must-watch items into your calendar with full lock-in.

Metrics to track:

* % of sessions where you had to mute/stop secondary media prematurely
* Subjective focus rating per session (1–5)
* Completion rate for primary tasks
* Satisfaction rating with media consumption (1–5)

---

## 12. Quick Reference Cards

**Primary-First Rule:**

* Pick main task → assign PTCL → choose media ≤ (6 – PTCL).

**Downgrade Ladder (if distracted):**

* Video essay → podcast → instrumental → silence.

**Upgrade Ladder (if bored during chores):**

* Instrumental → podcast → YouTube glance → familiar TV/film.

### Want It Automated or Integrated?

I can help:

* Build a Notion database with fields: Task, PTCL, Media Link, SMCD, Total Load, Notes.
* Create Apple Shortcuts/Keyboard Maestro macros to auto-start “default” pairings (e.g., open Focus playlist + Notion task).
* Set up weekly reflection prompts.

Just say the word if you want templates or automations.

**You now have a complete attention-media pairing system.** Try it for a week, log what fails/succeeds, and we’ll refine. Ready to build the tracking template or macros next?
